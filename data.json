    "description": "Mission\r\nThe A-10C Thunderbolt II is the first Air Force aircraft specially designed for close air support of ground forces. They are simple, effective and survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against light maritime attack aircraft and all ground targets, including tanks and other armored vehicles.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe A-10C offers excellent maneuverability at low airspeeds and altitude while maintaining a highly accurate weapons-delivery platform. They can loiter near battle areas for extended periods of time, are capable of austere landings and operate under 1,000-foot ceilings (303.3 meters) with 1.5-mile (2.4 kilometers) visibility. Additionally, with the capability of carrying precision guided munitions and unguided munitions, they can employ above, below and in the weather. Their wide combat radius and short takeoff and landing capability permit operations in and out of locations near front lines. Using night vision goggles, A-10C pilots can conduct their missions during darkness.\n\r\nThunderbolt IIs have Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS), goggle compatible single-seat cockpits forward of their wings, Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems, and a large bubble canopy which provides pilots all-around vision. The pilots are protected by titanium armor that also protects parts of the flight-control system. The redundant primary structural sections allow the aircraft to enjoy better survivability during close air support than previous aircraft.\n\r\nThe aircraft can survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high explosive projectiles up to 23mm. Their self-sealing fuel cells are protected by internal and external foam. Manual systems back up their redundant hydraulic flight-control systems. This permits pilots to fly and land when hydraulic power is lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn A-10 Thunderbolt II assigned to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mich., prepares to land on a public highway in Alpena, Mich., Aug. 5, 2021.

Many of the aircraft's parts are interchangeable left and right, including the engines, main landing gear and vertical stabilizers.\n\r\nAvionics equipment includes communications, inertial navigation and GPS, fire control and weapons delivery systems, target penetration aids and night vision goggles. Their weapons delivery systems include heads-up displays that indicate airspeed, altitude, dive angle, navigation information and weapons aiming references; and a low altitude safety and targeting enhancement system (LASTE) which provides constantly computing impact point freefall ordnance delivery. The aircraft also have armament control panels, and infrared and electronic countermeasures to handle surface-to-air-threats, both missile and anti-aircraft artillery.\n\r\nThe Thunderbolt II's 30mm GAU-8/A Gatling gun can fire 3,900 rounds a minute and can defeat an array of ground targets to include tanks. Some of their other equipment include electronic countermeasures, target penetration aids, self-protection systems and an array of air-to-surface weapons, including laser and GPS guided munitions, AGM-65 Maverick and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.\n\nBackground\r\nThe first production A-10A was delivered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in October 1975. It was designed specifically for the close air support mission and had the ability to combine large military loads, long loiter and wide combat radius, which proved to be vital assets to the United States and its allies during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Noble Anvil.\n\r\nIn the Gulf War, A-10s had a mission capable rate of 95.7%, flew 8,100 sorties and launched 90% of the AGM-65 Maverick missiles.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: A-10 -- close air support, airborne forward air control, combat search and rescue\r\nContractor: Fairchild Republic Co.\r\nPower Plant: Two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans\r\nThrust: 9,065 pounds each engine\r\nLength: 53 feet, 4 inches (16.16 meters)\r\nHeight: 14 feet, 8 inches (4.42 meters)\r\nWingspan: 57 feet, 6 inches (17.42 meters)\r\nSpeed: 420 miles per hour (Mach 0.56)\r\nCeiling: 45,000 feet (13,636 meters)\r\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 51,000 pounds (22,950 kilograms)\r\nRange: 800 miles (695 nautical miles)\r\nArmament: One 30mm GAU-8/A seven-barrel Gatling gun; up to 16,000 pounds (7,200 kilograms) of mixed ordnance on eight under-wing and three under-fuselage pylon stations, including 500 pound (225 kilograms) Mk-82 and 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) Mk-84 series low/high drag bombs, incendiary cluster bombs, combined effects munitions, mine dispensing munitions, AGM-65 Maverick missiles, laser-/GPS-guided bombs, unguided and laser-guided 2.75-inch (6.99 centimeters) rockets; infrared countermeasure flares; electronic countermeasure chaff; jammer pods; illumination flares and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.\r\nCrew: One\r\nDate Deployed: March 1976\r\nUnit Cost: $9.8 million (fiscal 98 constant dollars)\r\nInventory: Total Force \u2013 approximately 281\n\r\nPoint of Contact: Air Combat Command, Public Affairs Office; 115 Thompson St., Suite 121; Langley AFB, VA 23665-1987; DSN 574-5007 or 757-764-5007; e-mail: accpa.operations@us.af.mil\n\r\n(Current as of December 2020)"

The AC-130 aircrew earned the Lt. Gen. William H. Tunner Award for the mission.\n\r\nAC-130s also had a primary role during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 when they destroyed Panamanian Defense Force Headquarters and numerous command and control facilities. Aircrews earned the Mackay Trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year and the Tunner Award for their efforts.\n\r\nDuring Operation Desert Storm, AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces. Gunships were also used during operations Continue Hope and United Shield in Somalia, providing close air support for United Nations ground forces. Gunships also played a pivotal role in supporting the NATO mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The AC-130H provided air interdiction against key targets in the Sarajevo area.\n\r\nIn 1997, gunships were diverted from Italy to provide combat air support for U.S. and allied ground troops during the evacuation of American noncombatants in Albania and Liberia. AC-130s were also part of the buildup of U.S. forces in 1998 to convince Iraq to comply with U.N. weapons inspections.\n\r\nIn 1999, AC-130Us were involved in combat operations in Kosovo, where the first ever employment of the radar system to identify and attack targets was used.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe AGM-129A advanced cruise missile is a stealth, nuclear-capable cruise missile used exclusively by B-52H bombers.\n\nFeatures \r\nThe AGM-129A is a subsonic, turbofan-powered, air-launched cruise missile. It is harder to detect, and has greater range and accuracy than the AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile. The ACM achieves maximum range through its highly efficient engine, aerodynamics and fuel loading. B-52H bombers can carry up to six AGM-129A missiles on each of two external pylons for a total of 12 per aircraft. When the threat is deep and heavily defended, the AGM-129 delivers the proven effectiveness of a cruise missile enhanced by stealth technology. Launched in quantities against enemy targets, the ACM's difficulty to detect, flight characteristics and range result in high probability that enemy targets will be eliminated.\n\r\nThe AGM-129A's external shape is optimized for low observables characteristics and includes forward swept wings and control surfaces, a flush air intake and a flat exhaust. These, combined with radar-absorbing material and several other features, result in a missile that is virtually impossible to detect on radar.\n\r\nThe AGM-129A offers improved flexibility in target selection over other cruise missiles. Missiles are guided using a combination of inertial navigation and terrain contour matching enhanced with highly accurate speed updates provided by a laser Doppler velocimeter. These, combined with small size, low-altitude flight capability and a highly efficient fuel control system, give the United States a lethal deterrent capability well into the 21st century.\n\nBackground \r\nIn 1982 the Air Force began studies for a new cruise missile with stealth characteristics after it became clear that the AGM-86B would soon be too easy to detect by future air defense systems. In 1983 General Dynamics was awarded a contract to develop the new AGM-129A ACM. The first test missile flew in 1985; the first missiles were delivered to the Air Force in mid-1990.\n\r\nPlans called for an initial production of\u00a0approximately 1,500 missiles. The end of the Cold War and subsequent budget cuts led the Air Force to cease production after 460 missiles, with the final delivery in 1993. Several corporate changes during production resulted in Raytheon Missile Systems as the final production firm.\u00a0\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function: Air-to-ground strategic cruise missile\nContractor: Raytheon Missile Systems\nPower Plant: Williams International Corp.

    "description": "MissionThe AGM-130 is a powered air-to-surface missile designed for high- and low-altitude strikes at standoff ranges against a variety of targets.FeaturesCarrying forward the modular concept of the GBU-15 guided weapon system, the AGM-130 employs a rocket motor for extended range and an altimeter for altitude control. The AGM-130 provides a significantly increased standoff range than the GBU-15. The AGM-130 has two variants, based on the warhead: the AGM-130A with a MK-84 blast/fragmentation warhead and the AGM-130C with a BLU-109 penetrator.The AGM-130 is equipped with either a television or an imaging infrared seeker and data link. The seeker provides the launch aircraft a visual presentation of the target as seen from the weapon. During free flight, this presentation is transmitted by the AXQ-14 data-link system to the aircraft cockpit monitor.The seeker can be either locked onto the target before or after launch for automatic weapon guidance, or it can be manually steered by a weapon systems officer. Manual steering is performed through the two-way data link.The AGM-130 is designed for use in the F-15E aircraft. The development of the AGM-130 was initiated in 1984 as a product improvement to the GBU-15 guided glide bomb system. In the mid-1990s, the AGM-130 weapon system received a significant modification upgrade when Global Positioning System and inertial navigation systems guidance capabilities were added. This combined enhancement provided the AGM-130 weapon system with an adverse weather capability.BackgroundFor the primary mode of operation, the aircraft flies to a pre-briefed launch position. The survivability of aircraft and crew is enhanced by launching the weapon at low altitude and from a significant standoff range, thus avoiding detection by enemy air defenses. After launch, the weapon flies through glide-powered-glide phases toward the target area with midcourse guidance updates provided by global positioning system navigational information or by the weapon systems officer through the data link.Upon termination of the powered flight phase the rocket motor is ejected. As the target comes into view, the weapon systems officer has dual flexibility in guiding the weapon via the data link. For automatic terminal homing, the guidance tracker is locked on target but can be manually updated for precision bombing. When total manual guidance is used, the operator manually steers the weapon to the target. For those aircraft not equipped with a data-link pod, the weapon may be launched in a direct attack mode.The first unit was operational in 1994.Primary Function: Air-to-surface guided and powered bombContractor: Boeing Co.Thrust: ClassifiedLength: 12 feet, 10.5 inches (3.90 meters)Launch Weight: 2,917 pounds (1,312.65 kilograms)Diameter: 18 inches (45.72 centimeters)Wingspan: 59 inches (149.86 centimeters)Range: ClassifiedCeiling: 30,000-plus feet (9,091 meters)Speed: ClassifiedGuidance System: television/imaging infrared seeker man-in-the-loop; autonomous GPS/INSDate Deployed: 1994Unit Cost: Approximately $450,000 per weaponInventory: Classified."

    "title": "AGM-65 Maverick",
    "description": "MissionThe AGM-65 Maverick is a tactical, air-to-surface guided missile designed for close air support, interdiction and defense suppression mission. It provides stand-off capability and high probability of strike against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, transportation equipment and fuel storage facilities.FeaturesThe Maverick is a modular design weapon. A different combination of the guidance package and warhead can be attached to the rocket motor section to produce a different weapon. The Maverick has three different seekers and two different warheads. The solid-rocket motor propulsion section is common to all variants. The seeker options are electro-optical (EO) imaging, imaging infrared (IR) or a laser guidance package. The warhead is in the missile's center section. Either a 125-pound shaped-charge warhead or a 300-pound penetrator warhead can be used. A contact fuse in the nose fires the shaped-charge warhead. The penetrator uses a delayed-fuse, allowing the warhead to penetrate the target with its kinetic energy before firing. The latter is very effective against large, hard targets. The AGM-65 has a cylindrical body with long-chord delta wings and tail control surfaces mounted close to the trailing edge of the wing of the aircraft using it.A-10, F-15E and F-16 aircraft carry Mavericks. As many as six Mavericks can be carried by an aircraft, usually in three round, underwing clusters, allowing the pilot to engage several targets on one mission. The missile also has \"launch-and-leave\" capability that enables a pilot to fire it and immediately take evasive action or attack another target as the missile guides itself to the target. Mavericks can be launched from high altitudes to tree-top level and can hit targets ranging from a distance of a few thousand feet to 13 nautical miles at medium altitude. Maverick B models have an electro-optical television guidance system. After the protective dome cover is automatically removed from the nose of the missile and its video circuitry activated, the scene viewed by the guidance system appears on a cockpit television screen. The pilot selects the target, centers cross hairs on it, locks on, and then launches the missile. The Maverick B also has a screen magnification capability that enables the pilot to identify and lock on smaller and more distant targets.The Maverick D has an imaging infrared guidance system, operated much like that of the A and B models, except that infrared video overcomes the daylight-only, adverse weather limitations of the other system. The infrared Maverick D can track heat generated by a target and provide the pilot a pictorial display of the target during darkness and hazy or inclement weather.The Maverick E model is the only version having the laser-guided seeker section. It uses the heavyweight penetrator warhead. The U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps are the\u00a0users of this variant.The Maverick F is a naval variant of the D/G model (IR) currently in use by the U.S. Navy. It also uses the 300-pound penetrator warhead.The Maverick G model essentially has the same guidance system as the D, with some software modifications that track larger targets. The G model's major difference is its heavyweight penetrator warhead, while Maverick B and D models employ the shaped-charge warhead.Maverick K models are currently in development. They were developed by taking a G model and replacing the IR guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system.Maverick K and H models are currently in production. The Maverick K model was developed by taking a G model and replacing the IR guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system. The Maverick H model was developed by taking a B model and upgrading it to increase its capability.BackgroundThe Air Force accepted the first AGM-65A Maverick in August 1972. A total of 25,750 A and B Mavericks were purchased by the Air Force. Maverick A's have recently been phased out of the inventory. The Air Force is exploring the possibility of converting phased out A's and near obsolete B's and making an EO version to be named AGM-65H. The software in the H would be upgraded increasing its capability.The Air Force took delivery of the first AGM-65D in October 1983, with initial operational capability in February 1986. Delivery of operational AGM-65G missiles took place in 1989.More than 5,000 AGM-65 A/B/D/E/F/G's were employed during Operation Desert Storm, mainly attacking armored targets. Mavericks played a large part in the destruction of Iraq's significant military force.General Characteristics Primary Function: Air-to-surface guided missileContractors: Raytheon Systems Co.Power Plant: Thiokol TX-481 solid-propellant rocket motorLaunch Weight: AGM-65B/H, 462 pounds (207.90 kilograms); AGM-65D, 485 pounds (218.25 kilograms); AGM-65E, 777 pounds (353.2 kilograms); AGM-65F, 804 pounds (365.5 kilograms); AGM-65G, 670 pounds (301.50 kilograms); AGM-65K, 793 pounds (360.45 kilograms)Diameter: 1 foot (30.48 centimeters)Wingspan: 2 feet, 4 inches (71.12 centimeters)Range: ClassifiedSpeed: ClassifiedAircraft: Used aboard A-10, F-15E and F-16Guidance System: AGM-65B/H/K, electro-optical television; AGM-65D/F/G, imaging infrared; AGM-65E, laser guidedWarheads: AGM-65B/D/H, 125 pounds (56.25 kilograms), cone shaped; AGM-65E/F/G/K, 300 pounds (135 kilograms) delayed-fuse penetrator, heavyweightUnit Cost: $17,000 to $110,000 depending on the Maverick variantDate Deployed: August 1972Inventory: Classified"

    "title": "AGM-86B/C/D Missiles",
    "description": "Mission\r\nThe AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, or ALCM, and AGM-86C/D conventional air-launched cruise missile, or CALCM, were developed to increase the effectiveness of B-52H bombers. In combination, they dilute an enemy's forces and complicate defense of its territory.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe small, winged AGM-86B/C/D missile is powered by a turbofan jet engine that propels it at sustained subsonic speeds. After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine inlet deploy. The AGM-86B carries a nuclear payload and is able to fly complicated routes to a target through the use of a terrain contour-matching guidance system. The AGM-86C carries a conventional blast/fragmentation payload and the AGM-86D carries a conventional penetrating warhead. Both conventional variants employ a GPS aided inertial navigation system.\n\r\nAGM-86B/C/D missiles increase flexibility in target selection and can be air-launched in large numbers by the bomber force. B-52H bombers carry six AGM-86B/C/D missiles on each of two externally mounted pylons and eight internally on a rotary launcher, giving the B-52H a maximum capacity of 20 missiles per aircraft.\n\r\nAn enemy force would have to counterattack each of the missiles, making defense against them costly and complicated. The enemy's defenses are further hampered by the missiles' small size and low-altitude flight capability, which makes them difficult to detect on radar.\n\nBackground\r\nIn February 1974, the Air Force solicited development and flight-test of the prototype AGM-86A air-launched cruise missile, which was slightly smaller than the later B, C and D models. The AGM-86A model did not go into production. Instead, in January 1977, the Air Force began full-scale development of the AGM-86B, which greatly enhanced the B-52's capabilities and helped America maintain a strategic deterrent.\n\r\nProduction of the initial 225 AGM-86B missiles began in fiscal year 1980 and a production total of 1,715 missiles was completed in October 1986. The air-launched cruise missile had become operational four years earlier, in December 1982, with the 416th Bombardment Wing, Griffiss Air Force Base, New York, which deactivated when the base closed in 1995. Besides its initial basing at Griffiss AFB, the ALCM was based at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, Fairchild AFB, Washington, Eaker AFB, Arkansas, and Carswell AFB, Texas. Currently, the ALCM is located at Minot AFB, North Dakota, and Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.\n\r\nIn June 1986, a limited number of AGM-86B missiles were retrofitted to carry a high-explosive blast/fragmentation warhead. The Air Force designated this CALCM as the AGM-86C. This modification also replaced the B model's terrain contour-matching guidance system and integrated an onboard Global Positioning System coupled with its inertial navigation system to fly. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with pinpoint accuracy.\n\r\nThe CALCM became operational in January 1991 at the onset of Operation Desert Storm. Seven\r\nB-52s from Barksdale AFB launched 35 missiles at designated launch points in the U. S. Central Command's area of responsibility to attack high-priority targets in Iraq. These \"round-robin\" missions marked the beginning of the air campaign for Kuwait's liberation and are the longest known aircraft combat sorties up to that time (more than 14,000 miles and 35 hours of flight). Furthermore, this long-range standoff weapon that has been employed effectively in combat in operations: Desert Storm, Desert Strike, Desert Fox, Allied Force, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n\r\nDuring the period of 1996 through 2001, the Air Force contracted the conversion of excess ALCM inventory to produce 200 additional CALCMs. This missile variant, designated Block I, incorporated improvements such as a larger and improved conventional payload (3,000-pound blast class), a multi-channel GPS receiver and integration of the buffer box into the GPS receiver. The upgraded avionics package also retrofitted all existing CALCM (Block 0) inventory. So, all AGM-86C missiles became electronically identical. Additionally, this included a small inventory of missiles produced with a penetrating warhead capability designated as the AGM-86D.\n\r\nIn early spring of 2019, Air Force Global Strike Command retired the CALCM weapon system as more advanced long-range, stand-off weapons entered the active stockpile.\n\r\nThe AGM-86C/D missiles previously based at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and Andersen AFB, Guam, are now retired from the stockpile and are being stored at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, awaiting demilitarization funding.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Air-to-ground strategic cruise missile\nContractor:\u00a0Boeing Defense and Space Group\nGuidance Contractors: Litton Guidance and Control and Interstate Electronics Corp (AGM-86C/D model)\nPower Plant: Williams Research Corp.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) is a new generation air-to-air missile. It has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range capability and is scheduled to be operational beyond 2000. The AMRAAM is being procured for the Air Force, U.S. Navy and America's allies.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe AMRAAM program improves the aerial combat capabilities of U.S. and allied aircraft to meet current and future threat of enemy air-to-air weapons. AMRAAM is compatible with the Air Force F-15, F-16, F-22\u00a0and developmental F-35 and\u00a0Navy F/A-18 C-F.\n\r\nAMRAAM is a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The missile is faster, smaller and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It incorporates active radar with an inertial reference unit and micro-computer system, which makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft. Once the missile closes on a target, its active radar guides it to intercept. This enables the pilot to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets. The pilot may then perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to their targets.\n\nBackground\r\nThe AMRAAM program completed its conceptual phase in February 1979 when the U.S. Air Force selected two of five competing contractors, Hughes Aircraft Co. and Raytheon Co., to continue into the validation phase.\n\r\nDuring the 33-month validation phase the contractors continued missile development by building actual hardware to demonstrate their technological concepts. The program phase concluded in December 1981 after both contractors demonstrated that their flight-test missiles could satisfy Air Force and Navy requirements. The Air Force competitively selected Hughes Aircraft Co.'s Missile System Group, Canoga Park, Calif., as the full-scale developer.\n\r\nDuring the full-scale development phase, Hughes Aircraft Co. completed missile development and Raytheon was selected as a follower producer. A production contract to both vendors was awarded in 1987. More than 200 of the test missiles were launched during flight tests at Eglin AFB, Fla.; White Sands Missile Range, N.M.; and Point Mugu, Calif. AMRAAM is combat tested, scoring two kills during Operation Southern Watch, and one kill in Bosnia.\n\r\nAMRAAM has three variants - AIM-120A/B/C -- operational on U.S. Air Force F-15, F-16 and F-22\u00a0aircraft.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Air-to-air tactical missile\nContractor: Hughes Aircraft Co. and Raytheon Co.\nPower Plant: High performance\nLength: 143.9 inches (366 centimeters)\nLaunch Weight: 335 pounds (150.75 kilograms)\nDiameter: 7 inches (17.78 centimeters)\nWingspan: 20.7 inches (52.58 centimeters)\nRange: 20+ miles (17.38+ nautical miles)\nSpeed: Supersonic\nGuidance System: Active radar terminal/inertial midcourse\nWarhead: Blast fragmentation\nUnit Cost: $386,000\nDate Deployed: September 1991"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe AIM-9 Sidewinder is a supersonic, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile carried by fighter aircraft. It has a high-explosive warhead and an infrared heat-seeking guidance system. The Sidewinder was developed by the U.S. Navy for fleet air defense and was adapted by the U.S. Air Force for fighter aircraft use. Early versions of the missile were extensively used in the Southeast Asia conflict.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe AIM-9 has a cylindrical body with a roll-stabilizing rear wing/rolleron assembly. Also, it has detachable, double-delta control surfaces behind the nose that improve the missile's maneuverability. Both rollerons and control surfaces are in a cross-like arrangement.\n\r\nThe missile's main components are an infrared homing guidance section, an active optical target detector, a high-explosive warhead and a rocket motor.\n\r\nThe infrared guidance head enables the missile to home in on target aircraft engine exhaust. An infrared unit costs less than other types of guidance systems, and can be used in day/night and electronic countermeasures conditions. The infrared seeker also permits the pilot to launch the missile, then leave the area or take evasive action while the missile guides itself to the target.\n\nBackground\r\nThe AIM-9A, a prototype of the Sidewinder, was first fired successfully in September 1953. The initial production version, designated AIM-9B, entered the Air Force inventory in 1956 and was effective only at close range. It could not engage targets close to the ground, nor did it have nighttime or head-on attack capability. These shortcomings were eliminated on subsequent versions.\n\r\nThe AIM-9J, a conversion of the AIM-B and E models, has maneuvering capability for dogfighting, and greater speed and range, giving it greater enhanced aerial combat capability. Deliveries began in 1977 to equip the F-15 and other Sidewinder-compatible aircraft.\n\r\nThe AIM-9L added a more powerful solid-propellant rocket motor as well as tracking maneuvering ability. An improved active optical fuse increased the missile's lethality and resistance to electronic countermeasures. A conical scan seeker increased seeker sensitivity and improved tracking stability. The L model was the first Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all angles, including head-on. Production and delivery of the AIM-9L began in 1976.\n\r\nThe AIM-9P, an improved version of the J model, has greater engagement boundaries, enabling it to be launched farther from the target. The more maneuverable P model also incorporated improved solid-state electronics that increased reliability and maintainability. Deliveries began in 1978.\n\r\nThe AIM-9P-1 has an active optical target detector instead of the infrared influence fuse; the AIM-9P-2 added a reduced-smoke motor. The most recently developed version, the AIM-9P-3, combined both the active optical target detector and the reduced-smoke motor. It also has added mechanical strengthening to the warhead as well as the guidance and control section. The improved warhead uses new explosive material that is less sensitive to high temperature and has a longer shelf life.\n\r\nThe AIM-9M has the all-aspect capability of the L model, but provides all-around higher performance. The M model has improved defense against infrared countermeasures, enhanced background discrimination capability, and a reduced-smoke rocket motor. These modifications increase ability to locate and lock-on a target and decrease the missile's chances for detection. Deliveries of the M model began in 1983.\n\r\nThe AIM-9M-9 has expanded infrared countermeasures detection circuitry.\n\r\nAIM-9X is the newest variant of Sidewinder. The AIM-9X has the same rocket motor and warhead as the AIM-9M. Major physical changes from previous versions of the missile include fixed forward canards, and smaller fins designed to increase flight performance. The guidance section has been redesigned and features an imaging infrared seeker. The propulsion section now incorporates a jet-vane steering system for enhanced post-launch agility.

    "description": "BACKGROUND\r\nAir Combat Command (ACC), headquartered at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, is one of 10 major commands in the United States Air Force. As a result of its lineal consolidation with Tactical Air Command in September 1992, ACC has performed a myriad of missions during its 75-year history ranging from counter-air, air interdiction and close air support to manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air battle management, and offensive/defensive cyber operations. For more than seven decades, ACC has served as the primary provider of air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders.\n\nMISSION\r\nACC organizes, trains and equips Airmen who fight in and from multiple domains to control the air, space and cyberspace. As the lead command for fighter, command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, personnel recovery, persistent attack and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and cyber operations, ACC is responsible for providing combat air, space and cyber power, and the combat support that assures mission success to America's warfighting commands.\n\nFORCES AND ORGANIZATION\r\nThe command has 1,097 assigned aircraft, with 27 wings, 1,130 units at 195 non-expeditionary locations, and an additional eight wings, 241 units at 47 locations supporting expeditionary operations for a total of 35 wings, 1,372 units at 242 locations. The command\u2019s active duty, civilian and air reserve component totals 19,921 officers, 115,574 enlisted and 20,453 civilians for a combined total of 155,948. These are organized under five active duty numbered air forces and the Air Force Warfare Center. The command also has responsibility for inland search and rescue operations in the 48 contiguous states.\n\nFIRST AIR FORCE (AIR FORCES NORTHERN) (AFNORTH)\r\nAir Forces Northern, headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, is responsible for ensuring the air sovereignty and air defense of the continental United States, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. As the Continental United States Region (CONR) for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the command provides air defense through airspace surveillance and airspace control.\n\r\nFirst Air Force (AFNORTH) is also the designated air component for U.S. Northern Command that rapidly responds to non-military threats under the Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) mission. The organization assists civilian agencies before and during emergencies, natural or man-made disasters, and other DOD-approved activities. This role saves lives, relieves suffering, prevents property damage and provides humanitarian assistance where and when it is needed most in the United States.

    "title": "Air Education and Training Command",
    "description": "Air Education and Training Command, with headquarters at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, was established and activated in January 1942, making it the oldest major command in the Air Force. AETC\u2019s training mission makes it the first command to touch the lives of nearly every Air Force member. AETC was formed in 1942 as the Army Air Corps Flying Training Command with headquarters in Washington, D.C. Less than a year later, the headquarters moved to Fort Worth, Texas. During World War II the command provided technical and flying training at more than 600 installations, factories and institutions of higher learning. The headquarters moved to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in 1946, to Scott AFB, Illinois, in 1949, and finally to Randolph AFB in 1957. In July 1993, Air Training Command and Air University merged to form AETC. This redesignation allowed the command to retain all of its previous heritage and honors. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure plan renamed Randolph Air Force Base, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Over the years, more than 25 million students have graduated from AETC training and education programs.\n\nMission\r\nRecruit, train and educate exceptional Airmen.\n\r\nAETC takes America\u2019s sons and daughters \u2013 young men and women who have volunteered to serve their country in a time of war \u2013 and develop them into Airmen. \u201cDevelop\u201d denotes more than educating or training them \u2013 it implies bringing them to embrace Air Force culture, teaching them (by example) the Air Force core values of integrity, service before self and excellence in all we do.\n\nVision\r\nThe First Command: Developing Airmen of character, the foundation of a lethal force\n\nPriorities\r\nAdvance force development\r\nEnhance lethality and readiness\r\nTransform the way we learn\r\nCultivate an environment of excellence\r\nPersonnel and resources\n\r\nMore than 29,000 active-duty members, 6,000 Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel, and 14,000 civilian personnel make up AETC. The command also has more than 9,000 contractors assigned. AETC flies approximately 1,400 aircraft.\n\nOrganization\r\nAETC includes Air Force Recruiting Service, two numbered air forces and the Air University. The command operates 12 major installations and supports tenant units on numerous bases across the globe. There are also 16 active-duty and seven Reserve wings.\n\nAETC installations\r\nAltus Air Force Base, Oklahoma\r\nGoodfellow AFB, Texas\r\nJB San Antonio-Lackland, Texas\r\nJB San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas\r\nJB San Antonio-Randolph, Texas\r\nLuke AFB, Arizona\r\nColumbus AFB, Mississippi\r\nHolloman AFB, New Mexico\r\nKeesler AFB, Mississippi\r\nLaughlin AFB, Texas\r\nMaxwell AFB, Alabama\r\nSheppard AFB, Texas\r\nVance AFB, Oklahoma\n\nAir Force Recruiting Service\r\nAETC's mission begins with the Air Force Recruiting Service, with headquarters at JBSA-Randolph. AFRS comprises three regional groups and 27 squadrons with more than 1,200 recruiters assigned throughout the United States, England, Germany, Japan, Puerto Rico and Guam. The AFRS mission is to recruit quality men and women with the right skills, at the right time, in the right numbers to sustain the combat capability of the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force brings in nearly 24,000 active-duty enlisted accessions each year. The command is responsible for accessing 100% of the enlisted force, 90% of the service's medical officers, approximately 25% of the line officers (through Officer Training School) and 100% of Air Force chaplains.\n\nSecond Air Force: Basic, technical and expeditionary training\r\nSecond Air Force, with headquarters at Keesler AFB, is responsible for conducting basic military and non-flying technical training for Air Force, joint and coalition enlisted members and support officers. Second Air Force also oversees Airmen training for Joint Sourcing Solutions taskings.\n\nNineteenth Air Force: Mission oversight and execution\r\nNineteenth Air Force, with headquarters at JBSA-Randolph, is responsible for flying training execution, mentoring, safety, advocacy for subordinate units and security of operating environments. The 19th AF executes operational-level command and control of all formal aircrew flying training missions within AETC and provides world-class Airmen to the Combat Air Forces and Mobility Air Forces. The 19th AF provides operational control and administrative authority to support training world-class aircrews, air battle managers, weapons directors, Air Force Academy Airmanship programs and survival, escape, resistance and evasion specialists to sustain the combat capability of the Air Force, other services and U.S. allies.\n\nBasic military training\r\nThe first stop for all Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve enlisted personnel is basic military training at the 737th Training Group at JBSA-Lackland. In a typical year, between 20,000 and 30,000 new Airmen complete this intense, 8 1/2-week training course. JBSA-Lackland conducts the Air Force's only enlisted recruit training program, transforming civilians into motivated, disciplined warrior Airmen with the foundation to serve in the world\u2019s greatest Air Force. This includes basic war skills, military discipline, physical fitness, drill and ceremonies, Air Force core values, and a comprehensive range of subjects relating to Air Force life.\n\nTechnical training\r\nAfter completing basic training, Airmen begin technical training to learn the technical skills needed to perform in their career field specialties. Technical training is conducted primarily at six installations: JBSA-Lackland, JBSA-Fort Sam Houston, Goodfellow AFB, Sheppard AFB, Keesler AFB and Vandenberg AFB. Each base is responsible for a specific portion of the formal technical training Airmen require to accomplish the Air Force mission. Highly trained instructors conduct technical training in specialties such as aircraft maintenance, missile maintenance, civil engineering, medical services, computer systems, security forces, air traffic control, weather, personnel, cyberspace support, intelligence, fire fighting, and space and missile operations.\n\nExpeditionary training\r\nIncreased mission requirements have strained the U.S. Army's available manpower to meet combatant commander requirements. To meet these force requirements, the Army solicited Air Force and Navy support in the execution of ground operations \u2013 called Joint Sourcing Solutions taskings \u2013 to include performing entire missions in lieu of Army units.\n\r\nSecond Air Force provides centralized management and overarching command and control structure to oversee, prepare and equip Airmen for JSS expeditionary training in a sister service environment. Training is conducted at Army locations called Mobilization Force Generation Installations. The 602nd Training Group (Provisional) establishes detachments at each MFGI as Air Force liaisons and provides location command and control. JSS training is the means by which the Air Force will ensure each JSS Airman receives required combat skills training. Approximately 2,500-4,000 Airmen per year are trained at MSGIs and are sourced to fill JSS taskings; they are trained and equipped to fill any of 32 different mission sets.\n\nAerospace Physiology training program\r\nAETC is the lead command for Aerospace Physiology and has the authority and responsibility to develop, field and manage training curricula and systems to support AP, human performance and acceleration training requirements for all user commands. The AP Training Systems portfolio consists of 115 training systems that include altitude chambers, Reduced Oxygen Breathing Devices and Hypoxia Familiarization Trainers, parachute descent and landing trainers, ejection seat/egress trainers and Barany chairs across six major commands. The AP program provides critical aircrew training and mishap prevention efforts in support of Department of Defense and NATO undergraduate and graduate flying training as well as continuation training requirements across the spectrum of aircrew members\u2019 development and flying careers.\n\nFlying training\r\nAETC conducts flying training and is responsible for training aircrews and air battle managers.\n\r\nAETC conducts cadet airmanship programs at the United States Air Force Academy for more than 3,400 cadets per year.\n\r\nAir Force pilot, Remotely Piloted Aircraft pilot, and combat systems officer candidates begin with Initial Flight Screening/RPA Flight Screening in Pueblo, Colorado, to gauge aptitude for flight and introduce candidates to the rigors of military aviation and training.\n\r\nPilot candidates then attend either Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training at Sheppard AFB, or Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training at Columbus AFB, Laughlin AFB, or Vance AFB.\n\r\nAt ENJJPT, students learn with, and are taught by, U.S. Air Force officers and officers from various air forces of NATO allies. Student pilots fly the T-6 Texan II mastering contact, instrument, low-level and formation flying. Then they move onto a fighter-trainer, the T-38 Talon, and continue building the skills necessary to become a fighter pilot.\n\r\nSpecialized Undergraduate Pilot Training is divided into three phases, Academic/Ground Training, Primary Flying Training, and Advanced Flying Training. This training includes:\n\r\na. Flying training to teach the principles and techniques used in operating advanced aircraft\n\r\nb. Ground training to supplement and reinforce flying training\n\r\nc. Officer development training to strengthen the graduate\u2019s leadership skills, officer qualities, and understanding of the role of the military pilot as an officer and supervisor\n\r\nPrimary Flying Training is designed to teach the basic flying fundamentals necessary to safely operate any U.S. Air Force aircraft and lays the foundation for the advanced phase and for future responsibilities as military officers and leaders.\n\r\nAfter the primary phase of specialized training, student pilots are selected for one of three advanced training tracks based on needs of the Air Force and their class standing. Prospective airlift and tanker pilots are assigned to the airlift/tanker track and train in the T-1 Jayhawk. Student pilots headed for bomber or fighter assignments are assigned to the bomber/fighter track and train in the T-38. Both airlift/tanker track and fighter/bomber track training continues at Columbus, Laughlin, or Vance Air Force Bases. Students selected to fly helicopters train in the TH-1H at Fort Rucker, Alabama. Approximately 160 students per year will be selected for duty flying Remotely Piloted Aircraft.\n\r\nNew to the AETC flight training programs, the RPA pilot training program, known as Undergraduate RPA Training or URT, was built around the lessons learned from more than 65 years of U.S. Air Force pilot training and designed to train Pilot-in-Command skills to the fledgling RPA pilots. Unlike traditional pilots who would expect to be wingmen or co-pilots in initial combat mission ready status, the RPA pilots are immediately solo and in charge of their mission upon reaching mission ready status. They are also thrust straight into actual combat upon reaching mission ready status, so it was essential that AETC trained as many basic skills as possible in the undergraduate training to prepare the RPA pilots for flight in National/International Airspace and readiness to enter the Formal Training Unit for their assigned RPA. The RPA pilot requires many of the same skills and knowledge bases as the pilot of a traditional aircraft.\n\r\nAfter RPA Flight Screening at Pueblo, the RPA pilot students attend RPA Instrument Qualification course at JBSA-Randolph; a simulator only course in dedicated T-6 Fixed Training Devices. Finally, a month-long RPA Fundamentals Course at JBSA-Randolph is designed to give new RPA pilots without operational experience the tactical grounding experience needed to enter the Formal Training Units for the various RPAs: MQ-1, MQ-9, and RQ-4.\n\r\nIn addition to pilot and RPA pilot training, AETC provides Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training; this training takes place at NAS Pensacola, Florida. UCT combines skill sets of the legacy Navigator, Electronic Warfare Officer, and Weapon Systems Officer pipelines to produce an aviator skilled in advanced navigation systems, electronic warfare and weapons employment.\n\r\nThe Primary phase of UCT utilizes the T-6A and focuses on teaching students the fundamentals of instrument and visual navigation, while developing airmanship, and building a foundation of mission management skills. The advanced phase of training utilizes the CSO modified T-1A aircraft and the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat. In this final phase, student training is focused on advanced navigation techniques, radar scope interpretation, the principles of electronic warfare, Crew Resource Management, and the fundamentals of weapons employment. Airmanship and mission management skills continue to develop to ensure graduates have the necessary skills to succeed in a vast array of follow-on MWS platforms.\n\r\nAETC also provides follow-on training for most Air Force aircrew in their assigned aircraft. Pilots assigned to fighter aircraft complete the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals Course, flying the T-38C. Students then move on to train in the F-15 Eagle at Kingsley Field, Oregon or in the F-16 Fighting Falcon at Luke AFB, Arizona, Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona, or JBSA-Lackland, Texas. Students assigned to the KC-135 Stratotanker or C-17 Globemaster III aircraft are trained at Altus AFB, Oklahoma. Aircrews assigned to fly the C-130 train at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, and aircrews assigned to fly MC-130H Combat Talon II, MC-130J Commando II, MC-130P Combat Shadow, HC-130 Combat King, UH-1N Huey, HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters or CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, receive their training at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Training of U.S. Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter instructor pilots and operational test pilots began at Eglin AFB, Florida, continuing in 2012.\n\nEnlisted flying training\r\nAETC also provides enlisted aircrew training for a wide variety of aircrew specialties including flight engineers, air-to-air refueling boom operators, loadmasters, aerial gunners, airborne communications specialists, as well as the newest career enlisted aviator specialty \u2013 RPA sensor operator. Flight engineers train at Little Rock AFB, boom operators train at Altus AFB, and loadmasters train at Altus, Little Rock or JBSA-Lackland. Helicopter and tilt-rotor special mission aviators train at Kirtland AFB, and airborne communications specialists train at Keesler AFB. The RPA sensor operators complete the 3-skill level awarding course at JBSA-Randolph over a six-week period, learning the basic concepts of Full Motion Video, communications, different types of sensors and RPA crew duties before attending the FTU.\n\nSurvival, evasion, resistance and escape training\r\nAETC also conducts survival, evasion, resistance and escape training.\n\r\nThe 336th Training Group at the U.S. Air Force Survival School, Fairchild AFB, Washington, provides SERE training to at risk of isolation personnel. Instruction concentrates on the principles, techniques and skills necessary to survive with confidence in any environment and return with honor. In addition, the 336 TRG provides initial and follow-on training to all U.S. Air Force SERE specialists.\n\r\nSERE specialists assigned to the survival school teach 15 different courses to approximately 17,000 students annually. Nine courses are taught at Fairchild. The other six courses are conducted at 336 TRG detachments at Eielson AFB, Alaska, NAS Pensacola, Florida, and JBSA-Lackland, Texas.\n\nAir Battle Manager training\r\nAir Battle Manager candidates begin training with the nine-month ABM course at Tyndall AFB, Florida. They learn doctrine, radar theory, surveillance operations, wartime operations, joint tactical operations and basic fighter control using contract-flown MU-2 aircraft, and the F-15 Strike Eagle and F-22 Raptor aircraft from the 325th Fighter Wing.

The 14 members of the first known \"air force\" band set foot on French soil in September 1917, carrying instruments purchased with money from their lieutenant's personal funds. The commander of the 36th Aeronautics Squadron, to which they were assigned, was so impressed with his musicians that he petitioned the American Red Cross in Paris to help find more instruments, and increased the band's size.\n\r\nBands have come a long way since then. Throughout World War II, the bands of the Army Air Corps contributed significantly in supporting the morale of our troops. When the Air Force became a separate service in 1947, Air Corps bands also transferred to the young Air Force. Since then, bands have continued to inspire esprit de corps in our Airmen, patriotism in our citizenry, and admiration and respect from people of all nations.\n\r\nWith a legacy rooted in our American heritage, Air Force bands are attuned to the most current requirements and technology of the 21st century.\n\r\nFor additional information on Air Force bands, please visit our website: http://www.music.af.mil\n\nAir Force Bands and Areas of Responsibility\r\nThe United States Air Force Band\r\n201 McChord Street\r\nJoint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, DC 20032-0202\r\nAOR: National Capital Region and continental U.S. on a rotational basis\n\r\nThe United States Air Force Academy Band\r\n520 Otis Street\r\nPeterson Air Force Base, CO 80914-1620\r\nAOR: Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Continental US on a rotational schedule\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of the West\r\n2220 Carswell Avenue\r\nJoint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas\u00a078236-5500\r\nAOR: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Heritage of America Band\r\n86 Hickory Street\r\nJoint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23665-2192\r\nAOR: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Heartland of America Band\r\n109 Washington Square, Suite 111\r\nOffutt Air Force Base, NE 68113-2126\r\nAOR: Nebraska\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of Mid-America\r\n900 Chapman Drive\r\nScott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5115\r\nAOR: Arkansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Wisconsin\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of the Golden West\r\n551 Waldron Street\r\nTravis Air Force Base, CA 94535-5000\r\nAOR: Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington\n\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of Flight\r\n3920 Lear Street, Building 1420\r\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, 45433-5721\r\nAOR: Ohio\n\r\nThe United States Air Forces in Europe Band\r\nUnit 3150\r\nAPO AE 09094-3150\r\nAOR: Europe, Africa\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of the Pacific\r\nUnit 5075\r\nAPO AP 96328-5000\r\nAOR: Japan, Pacific theater\n\r\nUnited States Air Force Band of the Pacific-Hawaii*\r\n1225 Vickers Avenue\r\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, 96853-5399\r\nAOR: Alaska, Hawaii, Pacific theater\r\n*Named activity of the United States Air Force Band of the Pacific at a geographically separated location.\n\r\n(Current as of December 2019)"

The directorate consists of 13Ms, 1C1s, 1C8s, civilian equivalents, and the POM (XRP) and AO Requirements divisions.\n\nHistory\r\nAFFSA was established after Gen. Merrill McPeak, the 14th Air Force Chief of Staff, implemented major force structure changes. Gen. McPeak reduced the number of major air commands that existed in the Air Force at the time. The Air Force Communications Command transitioned to a Field Operating Agency and ultimately impacted the staffing capability of Air Force operations. AFFSA was designed to maintain a continued focus on flight operations, despite the service\u2019s fluctuating organizational blueprint. AFFSA was approved for operations in October 1991 and originally managed mission duties related to air traffic services, ATCALS, flight inspection, flight operations standards, Air Force Representatives, Notices to Air Missions, career field functional managers, and airspace management. The original unit was primarily comprised of AO professionals and grew over the next 30 years to become a U.S. Air Force Lead Agent responsible for fixed and deployable AO capabilities as well as earning the responsibility to provide training to AIS, TERPS, Automation, and RMC Technician students. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions prompted a move from the National Capital Region to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in July 2006, where its headquarters now resides adjacent to Tinker AFB. AFFSA members, past and present, are proud to be celebrating the agency\u2019s heritage as part of its 30-year anniversary in 2021.\n\nPoint of Contact\r\nAir Force Flight Standards Agency; 5316 S.

By the end of World War II, this function was aligned under the Air Inspector. In July 1948, Air Force Letter No. 20-4 directed consolidation of Headquarters U.S. Air Force inspection activities at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, and provided for inspectors general at echelons of command below Headquarters U.S. Air Force.\n\r\nOn Sept. 20, 1950, the Vice Chief of Staff authorized the creation of a Directorate of Technical Inspections at Norton AFB, California. Organized operations began in February 1951 with 128 officers, 29 noncommissioned officers and 31 civilians. Duties for this function included evaluations of and recommended improvements to the maintenance, modification and overhaul of aircraft, related components and equipment.\n\r\nTo complete the consolidation of activities required for effectively conducting its technical inspection mission, in Aug. 1951, the Deputy IG at Norton AFB subsumed the Directorate of Procurement and Supply Inspection which was transferred from the Pentagon. By the end of 1952, the Directorate of Readiness Inspection was also moved from the Deputy IG at Kelly AFB to Norton AFB to become the Directorate of Readiness and Materiel Inspections.\n\r\nOn Jan. 7, 1963, the Deputy Inspectors General for Safety and Inspections were combined to establish the U.S. Air Force Deputy Inspector General; however, safety activities were still divided. The Directorate of Aerospace Safety remained at Norton AFB while the Directorate of Nuclear Safety resided at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Under this plan, a single deputy was responsible for the Air Force Inspection System and safety programs.\n\r\nIn July 1964, the Office of Assistant for Medical Services was formed within the Deputy Inspector General organization, and the first legal advisor was assigned in June 1965.\n\r\nOn Dec. 31, 1971, the Air Force Inspection and Safety Center was activated to replace the 1002nd Inspector General Group.\n\r\nAs a result of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, the Inspector General moved directly under the Secretary of the Air Force in Sept. 1986. During this period, AFISC began planning for a new concept of multi-MAJCOM inspections, which were implemented in 1987 and1988.\n\r\nCongress approved closure of Norton AFB in 1990, and AFISC began initial planning to move its operation to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. In August 1991, the center was divided into the Air Force Inspection Agency and the Air Force Safety Agency, now the Air Force Safety Center. Both organizations settled at Kirtland AFB in July 1993.\n\r\n(Current as of November 2019)"

    "description": "The Air Force Logistics Management Agency, with headquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base Gunter Annex, Ala., is a field operating agency that reports to the Director of Transformation, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, Joint Base Andrews, Md.\n\nMission\u00a0\r\nTo sharpen agile combat support capabilities by generating logistics solutions, supporting wargames, and publishing ACS literature.\n\r\nThe\u00a0AFLMA mission is to consult, conduct studies and manage Air Force\u00a0logistics wargaming participation.\u00a0The agency develops Department\u00a0of Defense\u00a0and civilian partnerships to support the development of policy and identify the resources needed to deliver effective agile combat support across the full spectrum of operations. The AFLMA produces solutions to logistics problems and designs new and improved concepts, methods, and systems to improve overall logistics and combat capability. Also, the AFLMA publishes the Air Force Journal of Logistics and other publications on logistics issues.\n\nPersonnel\u00a0\r\nThe\u00a0staff is authorized\u00a052 military and civilian members, including 32 advanced academic degree authorizations.\n\nOrganization\r\nWithin AFLMA, there are\u00a0four divisions:\u00a0 Logistics\u00a0Studies, Logistics Business Operations, Logistics Transformation,\u00a0and Logistics Analysis.\u00a0\n\r\nThe Logistics\u00a0Studies Division comprises four branches: Contracting, Maintenance, Readiness and Wargames. Many of the personnel slots within the division are coded for advanced academic degrees, which are often filled by Air Force Institute of Technology graduates. Products from this division propose solutions that are not specific to a particular major command, but rather reflect an Air Force-centric view. The Contracting Branch focuses on developing procedures to enhance contracting effectiveness. The Maintenance Branch focuses on the study of logistics issues that impact the future of Air Force aircraft, munitions and missile maintenance. Branch members possess \"hands-on\" maintenance and contracting experience, as well as ready access to Headquarters USAF and MAJCOM staffs. The Readiness Branch mission is to enhance agile combat support and facilitate transformation by performing world-class improvement and consulting studies for a wide range of deployment and distribution planning issues affecting Air Force policy. Branch members have combined experience in the many facets of transportation, supply and logistics plans. Members of the Wargaming Branch enhance agile combat support and facilitate transformation by designing and executing comprehensive logistics play in Air Force Title X wargames. They support a variety of other Air Force wargames as well as Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), joint and interagency sponsored events.\n\r\nThe Logistics Business Operations Division includes the office of the Air Force Journal of Logistics,\u00a0information technology and business support offices. The mission of the office of the Air Force Journal of Logistics is to publish\u00a0the Air Force's only professional journal for logistics. In addition to this publication, the office also publishes a variety of monographs and books.\u00a0\n\r\nThe Logistics Transformation Division is dedicated to transformation efforts in the logistics community, heavily focused on Logistics Enterprise Architecture, or LogEA, and Expeditionary Combat Support System, or ECCS. \u00a0LogEA is\u00a0the single authoritative source of processes and systems models for Air Force logistics. It establishes the process framework, standards and guidelines to define the environment in which future state systems can be identified, acquired or built. It aims to serve as a catalyst for developing doctrine, policies and organizational structure to position the Air Force for efficient and effective logistics support. LogEA will be an aggregate of graphical depictions of AF logistics processes, information, and their interaction that will provide a capability to plan, model, and simulate future logistic visions. This will help plan investments, give insight to redundancies, sub-optimizations, and guide further transformation within the logistics domain. The Air Force has chosen an Enterprise Resource Planning strategy to define the system that will enable LogEA. ECSS is the system fulfilling this Enterprise Resource Planning\u00a0role. This division strives to further transformation through research and implementation of eLog21 initiatives.\u00a0\n\r\nThe\u00a0Logistics Analysis Division provides analytical and quantitative support for agency projects. The division reviews project reports for technical quality, and leads analysis efforts for quantitative, modeling and simulation projects. Also, the division provides analytical support for logistics play at major Air Force and DOD wargames.\n\nVision\nGenerating transformational solutions,\u00a0focusing the logistics enterprise of the future.\u00a0\n\r\nA vital element of attaining the AFLMA vision with dwindling resources will be the application of Air Force Smart Operation for the 21st Century or AFSO 21 principles to the internal processes of the agency. All resources must be focused on the mission, eliminating non-value added efforts and executing the mission efficiently and effectively. At the same time, AFSO 21 principles will be incorporated in the recommendations developed by the AFLMA, so that decisions based on those recommendations will yield efficient and effective processes throughout the logistics community, ultimately resulting in sharpened agile combat support\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nHistory\r\nIn late 1975, the Air Force established the Air Force Logistics Management Center\u00a0at Gunter Air Force Station, Ala. It was created in response to a need to centrally manage logistics study improvement efforts and concentrate management emphasis on enhancing combat effectiveness. AFLMC was renamed the Air Force Logistics Management Agency\u00a0in 1993. Its charter was, and still is, to solve logistics problems.\n\r\nSince its inception, AFLMA has provided a continuing study, analysis, and development capability to the Air Force logistics community. Tackling and solving the toughest Air Force logistics problems remain its focus. From its beginnings, AFLMA has grown to be recognized for its excellence.\n\r\nTo maintain its recognized high standard of excellence and continue providing the highest quality support to the Air Force logistics community, AFLMA has developed strong working relationships with RAND and the Logistics Management Institute. Additionally, the AFLMA has forged partnering and teaming efforts with a variety of other Air Force, public and private sector organizations."

    "title": "Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency",
    "description": "History\nThe Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency was originally established in 1975 as the Air Force Management Engineering Agency, a separate operating agency reporting directly to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, when the Air Force decided it needed an agency to provide technical guidance and central direction to its management engineering program.\u00a0 In 1978, the agency became a named unit and was realigned under the Air Force Manpower and Personnel Center. In 1985, it was redesignated as a separate operating agency under its original name under Headquarters U.S. Air Force. In 1995, the Air Force Chief of Staff directed the Air Force to \"operationalize\" its Total Quality Management Program. As a result, the agency merged with the Air Force Center for Quality and Innovation to become the Air Force Center for Quality and Management Innovation in 1996. To further operationalize quality, the manpower-quality function under the Air Force planning and programming guidance was reengineered to streamline operations. As a result of that effort, the agency was redesignated as the Air Force Manpower and Innovation Agency in 2001.\nStarting in 1992, the agency took over the field management engineering teams originally assigned to the Air Force major commands and reorganized them on a functional basis. The agency was again redesignated as the Air Force Manpower Agency in 2004, and the teams were restructured into five numbered squadrons and two numbered flights to provide geographic and functional expertise, representing a shift in mission priorities to better support the expeditionary Air Force.\nIn 2012, the agency was realigned under the Air Force Personnel Center as the Directorate of Manpower and later reactivated in its current form as the Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency in 2015. Its mission throughout its existence has been to provide Air Force leaders the analysis and tools to identify manpower requirements for the most effective and efficient accomplishment of Air Force missions.\nAFMAA 2021\u00a0documents its\u00a0transformation into a more agile and responsive agency.\u00a0The National\u00a0 Defense Strategy charges the Department of Defense to \u201cmake difficult choices and prioritize what is most important to field a lethal, resilient, and rapidly adapting Joint Force.\u201d\u00a0 This required AFMAA to realign its\u00a0priorities and strategies ensuring the future AFMAA is positioned to not only meet new challenges, but to outpace any competitors with superior services in the quest \u201cTo be the Air Force Manpower Center of Excellence.\u201d\u00a0Go here to learn more.\n(Current as of June 2020)"

    "title": "Air Force Office of Special Investigations",
    "description": "The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is a field operating agency with headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. It has been the Air Force's felony-level investigative service since Aug. 1, 1948. The agency reports to the Inspector General, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.\n\r\nMissionThe Air Force Office of Special Investigations provides professional investigative service to commanders of all Air Force activities. AFOSI identifies, investigates and neutralizes criminal, terrorist, and espionage threats to Air Force and Department of Defense personnel and resources. The command focuses on five priorities:\n\nDevelop and retain a force capable of meeting Air Force needs\nDetect and provide early warning of worldwide threats to the Air Force\nIdentify and resolve crime that threatens Air Force readiness or good order and discipline\nCombat threats to information systems and technologies\nDetect and defeat fraud impacting force acquisitions and base-level capabilities\n\nPersonnel and ResourcesAFOSI has 2,609 active-duty, Reserve and civilian personnel. Of this number, approximately 2,009 are federally credentialled special agents, who are drawn from all segments of the total force. There are 328 active-duty officers, 941 active-duty enlisted, 425 civilians and 379 reservists.\n\nOrganization\r\nIn addition to the command's headquarters OSI has eight field investigations regions. Seven of the regions are aligned with Air Force major commands: Region 1 with Air Force Materiel Command, Region 2 with Air Combat Command, Region 3 with Air Mobility Command, Region 4 with Air Education and Training Command, Region 5 with U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Region 6 with Pacific Air Forces, and Region 8 with Air Force Space Command.\n\r\nWhile the regions serve the investigative needs of those aligned major commands, all OSI units and personnel remain independent of those commands, and their chains of command flow directly to OSI headquarters. Such organizational independence ensures unbiased investigations.\n\r\nThe single region not aligned with a major command is Region 7, the mission of which is to provide counterintelligence and security-program management for special-access programs under the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.\n\r\nAt the regional level are subordinate units called field investigations squadrons, detachments and operating locations. In sum, OSI owns more than 230 units worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence was placed around the Osan AB Air Force Office of Special Investigations compound for a forensic exercise April 29, 2011. Osan\u2019s AFOSI detachment took the opportunity to not only practice their own skills, but also teach and learn from local Republic of Korea air force members and Korean police investigators.

Air Force Office of Special Investigations special agents can specialize in several disciplines following training and a one-year probationary period. (U.S. Air Force photo/Lance Cheung)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations\nThreat detection. OSI manages offensive and defensive activities to detect, counter and destroy the effectiveness of hostile intelligence services and terrorist groups that target the Air Force. These efforts include investigating the crimes of espionage, terrorism, technology transfer and computer infiltration. This mission aspect also includes providing personal protection to senior Air Force leaders and other officials, as well as supervising an extensive antiterrorism program in geographic areas of heightened terrorist activity.\n\nCriminal Investigations. The vast majority of OSI's investigative activities pertain to felony crimes including murder, robbery, rape, assault, major burglaries, drug use and trafficking, sex offenses, arson, compromise of Air Force test materials, black market activities, and other criminal activities\n\nEconomic crime investigations. A significant amount of OSI investigative resources are assigned to fraud (or economic crime) investigations. These include violations of the public trust involving Air Force contracting matters, appropriated and nonappropriated funds activities, computer systems, pay and allowance matters, environmental matters, acquiring and disposing of Air Force property, and major administrative irregularities. OSI uses fraud surveys to determine the existence, location and extent of fraud in Air Force operations or programs. It also provides briefings to base and command-level resource managers to help identify and prevent fraud involving Air Force or DOD resources.\n\nInformation Operations. The Air Force is now countering a global security threat to our information systems. Our role in support of Information Operations recognizes future threats to the Air Force, and our response to these threats, will occur in cyberspace. OSI's support to Information Operations comes in many facets. OSI's computer crime investigators provide rapid worldwide response to intrusions into Air Force system.\n\nTechnology Protection. The desires of potential adversaries to acquire or mimic the technological advances of the U.S. Air Force have heightened the need to protect critical Air Force technologies and collateral data. The AFOSI Research and Technology Protection Program provides focused, comprehensive counterintelligence and core mission investigative services to safeguard Air Force technologies, programs, critical program information, personnel and facilities.\n\nSpecialized Services. AFOSI has numerous specialists who are invaluable in the successful resolution of investigations. They include technical specialists, polygraphers, behavioral scientists, computer experts and forensic advisers..\n\nDefense Cyber Crime Center.\u00a0 The Secretary of the Air Force through AFOSI is the DOD executive agent for\u00a0the Defense Cyber Crime Center which comprises the the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory, the Defense Computer Investigations Training Academy and the Defense Cyber Crime Institute. The forensics laboratory provides computer-evidence processing, analysis, and diagnosis to support DOD counterintelligence, terrorism, criminal, and fraud investigations. The cyber training academy produces cyber investigators and digital forensics examiners to support DOD, while the institute performs\r\nsoftware test and validation and research and development on forensic\r\nsoftware and hardware tools.\u00a0\n\nAntiterrorism teams. Created out of a need to meet the increasing challenges presented by worldwide terrorism, AFOSI antiterrorism teams are maintained around the globe. These highly trained and specialized units stand ready on a moment's notice to deploy globally to provide antiterrorism, counterintelligence information collections and investigative services to Air Force personnel and units.\n\nTraining and Physical Requirements\r\nAll new AFOSI special agent recruits -- whether officer, enlisted or civilian -- receive their entry-level training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga. The training requires that each recruit meet physical requirements that are located on the FLETC web site at www.fletc.gov. The candidates attend a mandatory, 11-week Criminal Investigator Training Program with other federal law enforcement trainees. That course is followed by six weeks of AFOSI agency-specific coursework. Both courses offer new agents training in firearms and other weapons, defensive tactics, forensics, surveillance and surveillance detection, antiterrorism techniques, crime scene processing, interrogations and interviews, court testimony, and military and federal law.\u00a0\n\r\nUpon graduation, new AFOSI special agents spend a one-year probationary period in the field. Upon successful completion, some agents receive specialized training in economic crime, antiterrorism service, counterintelligence, computer crimes and other sophisticated criminal investigative capabilities. Others attend 12 weeks of technical training to acquire electronic, photographic and other skills required to perform technical surveillance countermeasures. Experienced agents selected for polygraph duties attend a 14-week DOD course.\n\r\nEach recruit is expected to participate in each of the following exercises: flexibility, bench press, 1.5 mile run/walk and agility run. All students are tested to determine their fitness level, and each test is age and gender normed. Special agents are expected to remain physical fit throughout their employment and are allowed five hours of duty time to participate in physical fitness activities.\n\nHistory\r\nAFOSI was founded Aug. 1, 1948, at the suggestion of Congress to consolidate investigative activities in the U.S. Air Force. Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington created OSI and patterned it after the FBI. He appointed Special Agent Joseph Carroll, an assistant to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, as the first AFOSI commander and charged him with providing independent, unbiased and centrally directed investigations of criminal activity in the Air Force."

    "description": "The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, is a direct reporting unit under U.S. Air Force Headquarters, the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia. It is the Air Force independent test agency responsible for testing, under operationally realistic conditions, new systems being developed for Air Force and multi-service use.\n\nVision\r\nLeader of the Test Enterprise \u2013 Accelerating Change.\n\nMission\r\nInform the Warfighter and Acquisition through operational testing.\n\nPersonnel and Organization\r\nAFOTEC employs more than 670 military and civilian personnel at its headquarters and four detachments located at Edwards Air Force Base, California; Eglin AFB, Florida; Hill AFB, Utah; Nellis AFB, Nevada, and multiple operating locations around the country.\n\r\nTest teams conduct tests at selected sites; collect, analyze and evaluate the data; and prepare formal reports. The teams are managed by AFOTEC and include personnel from the operating and supporting commands who will eventually employ these systems.\n\nOperational Testing\r\nAFOTEC\u2019s independent and objective evaluations of how well systems will meet operational requirements provide a vital link between the developer and user. They are key elements of the system acquisition approval process.\n\r\nOperational tests are designed to address critical issues regarding a system\u2019s performance in combat-like environments when operated by field personnel. They seek to answer questions about how safe, effective, reliable, maintainable, compatible and logistically supportable new Air Force systems will be.\n\r\nThe results of AFOTEC\u2019s tests, normally conducted on prototype and pre-production models, play an important role in Air Force and Department of Defense acquisition decisions. Test results also identify deficiencies requiring corrective action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Airman assigned to the 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron performs pre-flight checks on an HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter in full Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear flight gear during a developmental test at Nellis Air Force Base, April 21, 2021. Airmen provided individual notes to assessors following the test in order to make changes or improvements. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Dwane R.

The test address the new modular handgun system\u2019 capability to resist damage during ejection and still function as designed after sustaining ejection forces.  This is the first time any service has conducted this type of demonstration to ensure a side arm is safe for aircrew to carry in ejection seat aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Wesley Farnsworth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Test\nThe Six Principles of Test were adopted by the Service Operational Test Agencies and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to focus on delivering combat capability at the speed of relevance. The principles apply to all acquisition types, technology demonstrations, and experimentation. The way test and evaluation supports quantity, speed to field, and increased performance is by testing earlier, faster, smarter, discovering problems early, and reducing overall test-related costs. The efforts buy-down costs, shorten development and production time, maximize the potential to move major decision points left, and support earlier fielding of combat capability.\n\nEarly Operational Testing Involvement: Involve in programs as early as possible with acquisition partners; design integrated test events in an environment that can collect data once to answer respective test objectives.\n\nTailor to the Situation: Empower test teams with flexibility to adjust their tests as needed in order to field capabilities as rapidly as possible; teams know they have the flexibility to tailor their test planning, execution, and reporting as needed.\n\nContinuous and Cumulative Feedback: Ensure integrated test provides timely feedback regarding the problems discovered throughout the life of a program, especially in the earlier stages; testing is a continuum and partnership with program managers and users \u2013 no \u201cfinal exam\u201d surprise.\n\nStreamline Processes and Products: Remove bureaucratic constraints from current processes to deliver combat capability to accrue warfighting advantages to the U.S. and our allies.\n\nIntegrated and Combined Collection/Test: Pursue synchronized collection and data throughout acquisition stakeholder communities; use all test events at any point in the program to achieve contractor, developmental, and operational test objectives in a collaborative fashion to the maximum extent possible. One team, one plan, one test.\n\nAdaptive: Allow Airmen the freedom and latitude to change in order to take advantage of learning during the test process or as processes change.\n\nHistory\r\nThe Air Force activated the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center as a separate operating agency reporting directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff Jan. 1, 1974 at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M. The center achieved initial operational capability in April 1974 and full operational capability by October 1974.\n\r\nOn April 4, 1983, the center was redesignated the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center to clearly delineate its role as the Air Force's operational test agency. The Air Force redesignated AFOTEC a direct reporting unit to the\u00a0CSAF, Feb. 5, 1991. Later, in 1991, the Air Force broadened AFOTEC's responsibilities by re-assigning all initial, qualification, and selected follow-on operational tests and evaluations from the major commands to the center.\n\r\nAFOTEC's test and evaluation mission further expanded in 1997 when the center absorbed the \"non-traditional\" testing mission of the disbanded Defense Evaluation Support Activity. AFOTEC's mission success is reflected in its receipt of 13 Air Force Organizational Excellence Awards.\n\r\n(Current as of August 2021)"

    "title": "Air Force Rescue Coordination Center",
    "description": "As the United States' inland search and rescue, or SAR, coordinator, the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center serves as the single agency responsible for coordinating on-land federal SAR activities in the 48 contiguous United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\r\nThe AFRCC\u00a0is aligned under First Air Force or AFNORTH, and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The center, located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., directly ties in to the Federal Aviation Administration's alerting system and the U.S. Mission Control Center. In addition to the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking information, the AFRCC computer system contains resource files that list federal and state organizations, which can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout North America.\n\r\nWhen a distress call is received, the center investigates the request, coordinates with federal, state, and local officials, and determines the type and scope of response necessary. Once verified as an actual distress situation, AFRCC requests support from the appropriate federal SAR force. This may include Civil Air Patrol, U.S. Coast Guard, or other Department of Defense assets, as needed. State agencies can be contacted for state, local, or civil SAR resource assistance within their jurisdiction. The AFRCC chooses the rescue force based on availability and capability of forces, geographic location, terrain, weather conditions, and urgency of the situation.\n\r\nDuring ongoing SAR missions, the center serves as the communications hub and provides coordination and assistance to on-scene commanders or mission coordinators in order to recover the mission's objective in the safest and most effective manner possible. AFRCC uses state-of-the-art technology including a network of satellites for monitoring emergency locator transmitter signals. Systems such as these help reduce the critical time required to locate and recover people in distress.\n\r\nThe AFRCC\u00a0formulates and manages SAR plans, agreements and policies throughout the continental United States. Additionally, it offers a mobile Search Management Course to Civil Air Patrol wings and state and local agencies throughout the United States to produce qualified incident commanders thus improving national SAR capability.\n\r\nThe AFRCC also assigns instructors to the National SAR School at the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve Training Center at\u00a0Yorktown, Va. The instructors teach the Inland Search and Rescue Class throughout the United States and at many worldwide military locations. This joint school is designed for civilian and military personnel from federal, state, local and volunteer organizations, all of who are responsible for SAR mission planning.\n\r\nSearch and rescue missions include a variety of missions: searches for lost hunters, hikers or Alzheimer's patients; sources of emergency locator transmitter signals; and missing aircraft. The center frequently dispatches rescue assets to provide aid and transportation to people needing medical attention in remote or isolated areas, for emergency organ or blood transportation, or for medical evacuations, when civilian resources are not available.\n\r\nBefore 1974, the Air Force divided the continental United States into three regions, each with a separate rescue center. In May of that year, the Air Force consolidated the three centers into one facility at Scott AFB, Ill. This provided better coordination of activities, improved communications and economy of operations, and standardized procedures. In 1993, AFRCC relocated to Langley AFB, Va., when Air Combat Command assumed responsibility for Air Force peacetime and combat SAR. In October 2003, the center was realigned under the Air Force Special Operations Command. Then in April 2006, the AFRCC was realigned back to\u00a0ACC. On March 1, 2007, the AFRCC was moved from Langley to Tyndall AFB, Fla., under the 1st Air Force commander. Since the center opened in May 1974, missions have resulted in more than 13,900 lives saved.\n\nConsole operations:\r\n850-283-5955 (SAR Controllers)\r\nDSN 523-5955"

    "title": "Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps",
    "description": "Mission\r\nDevelop Air Force and Space Force Leaders of Character Whom We Expect to Fight and Win Our Nation\u2019s Wars.\n\nPersonnel and Resources\r\nAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corps comprises 145 detachments with more than 1,100 associated cross-town universities, four regional commands and a higher headquarters staff located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala. In 2022, AFROTC commissioned 2,109 second lieutenants into the United States Air Force and 141 into the United States Space Force.\n\nOrganization\r\nAFROTC is the largest and oldest source of commissioned officers for the Air Force. AFROTC is designed to recruit, educate and commission officer candidates through academic education, Field Training and Officer Development programs based on Air Force and Space Force requirements. Students can attend classes through host or cross-town enrollment programs. Cadet enrollments have ranged from a high of 23,605 in 1986 to a low of 10,231 in 1993.\n\nHistory\r\nThe Reserve Officer Training Corps was established with the passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, which established program guidelines that remained in effect until 1964. The Army Reorganization Act of 1920 created ROTC units specifically designed to train rated officers for the Air Corps. By 1926, seven such units existed, but a lack of funds to support flight training forced three to close in 1928 and the remaining units only trained non-rated officers. Since the Air Corps had virtually no requirement for non-rated officers, it closed the remaining units in 1933.\n\r\nAfter World War II, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff of the War Department, signed General Order No. 124, establishing AFROTC units at 78 colleges and universities throughout the nation. Eligible Air Force enlisted men and women pursuing a college degree who were interested in becoming commissioned officers were given that opportunity through competition in the AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program, established in 1973.\n\r\nIn 1978, Air Training Command assumed responsibility for AFROTC programs. On July 1, 1993, ATC merged with Air University to form Air Education and Training Command. Air University became a direct reporting unit under AETC, and AFROTC was realigned under Air University.\n\r\nIn Feb. 1997, AFROTC and Officer Training School merged under the newly created parent organization, Headquarters Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools. This restructuring placed oversight for three-quarters of Air Force officer production under one command and facilitated the sharing of manpower and expertise with minimum effect on the day-to-day operations of either organization. In June 2008, HQ AFOATS was re-designated as the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development. In 2020, United States Space Force officers began commissioning through the AFROTC program.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA platoon of Clemson University Air Force Reserve Officer's Training Corps cadets practice marching in formation on a beautiful spring day on campus, March 12, 2018.

Jenne)\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Details\n /\r\n                \nDownload Hi-Res\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFROTC Program\r\nThe first two years of AFROTC\u2019s four-year program, the General Military Course, consist of one hour of classroom work, two hours of leadership laboratory and three hours of physical conditioning each week. Upon completion of GMC requirements, cadets who wish to compete for entry into the last two years of the program, the Professional Officer Course, must do so under the requirements of the POC selection system. This system uses qualitative factors, such as grade point average, detachment commander\u2019s evaluation, aptitude test scores and physical fitness test scores, to determine a student's officer potential. After selection, students must successfully complete summer Field Training at Maxwell AFB.\n\r\nField Training is a required, integral component of the AFROTC curriculum that typically occurs after the cadet has satisfied the GMC (underclassmen) requirements and before entry into the POC (upperclassmen). It consists of a series of strategically planned events with the purpose to train, evaluate and grow cadets through a transformational experience. In addition, Space Force cadets undergo a U.S. Space Force specific Field Training course. Field Training culminates in a graduation event that includes an interactive leadership development course focused on preparing cadets for leadership challenges at their detachments.\n\r\nIn the POC, cadets attend class three hours a week, participate in a weekly leadership laboratory lasting two hours and perform three hours of physical conditioning per week. Cadets apply what they have learned in the GMC and at Field Training. Under the guidance of detachment cadre, POC cadets conduct leadership laboratories and manage the unit's cadet corps. Each unit has a cadet corps based on the Air Force organizational pattern of flight, squadron, group and wing. POC classes are small, with emphasis on group discussions and cadet presentations. Classroom topics include leadership, communication skills and national defense policy. Additionally, Space Force cadets have USSF specific curriculum blocks as POCs and have opportunities for summer internships with active USSF units. Once enrolled in the POC, all cadets are enlisted in the Air Force Reserve and assigned to the Obligated Reserve Section. Finally, once cadets graduate both USAF and USSF cadets are commissioned into the United States Air Force Reserve then upon active duty entry the newly commissioned officers are scrolled into the USAF or USSF.\n\nScholarships\r\nTo meet Air Force and Space Force production and accession requirements, the AFROTC College Scholarship Program awards the majority of its scholarships to candidates pursuing undergraduate engineering, math, physics and other similar technical disciplines. Although most AFROTC scholarships are awarded to students in technical majors, students in non-technical degree programs may also be eligible for scholarship opportunities.\n\r\nScholarships are awarded in increments from two to four years. AFROTC offers several types of scholarships. Type 1 covers full tuition and most required fees. Type 2 covers tuition and fees but is capped at $18,000 annually.\n\r\nAll scholarship cadets are required to meet certain academic, military and physical fitness standards to earn and maintain scholarship benefits. By law, scholarship recipients must be younger than 31 as of Dec. 31 of the calendar year during which commissioning is scheduled.\n\nMedical Professions\r\nNursing majors may apply for an AFROTC scholarship, and graduates agree to accept a commission in the Air Force Nurse Corps and serve four years on active duty after successfully completing their licensing examination. Cadet pre-medical scholarship recipients who are accepted to medical school within one year of graduating may be sponsored in their pursuit of medical degrees.\n\nLegal Professions\r\nBoth first-year and second-year law students can apply for AFROTC scholarships. Students complete either a one-year or two-year AFROTC program while attending law school.\n\r\nAdditionally, second-year law students can pursue an Air Force commission through AFROTC's graduate law program. This program guarantees judge advocate duty after a student completes all AFROTC, law school and bar requirements. After graduating from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association, the student must be admitted to practice law before the highest state court of any state or a federal court. The new lawyer is then commissioned into the Air Force in the grade determined by the laws and directives in effect at the time of call to active duty.\n\nAirman Commissioning Opportunities\r\nAFROTC has three programs in which Air Force enlisted personnel may pursue a commission. Scholarships for Outstanding Airmen to ROTC allows Major Command commanders to recognize outstanding airmen by nominating them for an AFROTC scholarship in any major. The Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program allows airmen to compete for AFROTC scholarships while coordinating their application package with the AFROTC unit they are interested in attending. Although any major may be selected, technical and nursing are usually considered more favorably. Both scholarship programs are available in two- to four-year lengths. To be eligible for a scholarship, Airmen must be working on their first bachelor's degree and cannot exceed age limits as prescribed by public law. The Professional Officer Course Early Release Program is available to Airmen who may not be eligible or competitive for a scholarship due to age, degree program or grade point average. Individuals compete for allocations while coordinating their application package with the AFROTC unit they are interested in attending. These three AFROTC programs require the selected Airmen to leave active duty to complete their degree and Air Force requirements necessary to earn a commission.\n\r\nEnlisted personnel interested in completing their undergraduate degree and commissioning have two additional programs available. Enlisted members interested in becoming a registered nurse can apply for the Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program. NECP provides an advancement pathway for enlisted Airmen to receive an active commission through the Nurse Corps. NECP is a wonderful opportunity for enlisted Airmen to complete a full-time Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree at an accredited university while on active duty. Contact the Chief Nurse at the nearest active duty, Guard or Reserve Medical Treatment Facility for more information and guidance. The Senior Leader Enlisted Commissioning Program allows senior leaders of the Air Force to select one enlisted member each to attend college full-time for up to 3 years to complete their undergraduate degree while receiving full pay and benefits. Upon graduation, they will attend Officer Training School and commission as a second lieutenant.\n\r\nMore information about these programs can be obtained from a base education office, an AFROTC unit, or by logging on to https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Holm-Center/AFROTC/\u200b.\n\nFor More Information\r\nThe Air Force and Space Force is seeking talented and motivated high school and college students with solid character and demonstrated leadership potential. In the AFROTC program, cadets are students first and spend an average of four to six contact hours weekly as freshmen/sophomores. As juniors and seniors, cadets spend six to ten hours of contact time weekly as they work to build and refine their leadership skills. Successful completion of a four-year accredited degree program and AFROTC leads to a commission as a second lieutenant in the best Air Force and Space Force in the world.

These functions were consolidated in an inspector general group at Norton AFB, California, in the 1950s.\n\r\nOn Dec. 31, 1971, the Air Force Inspection and Safety Center was activated, replacing the 1002nd Inspector General Group. The center was then divided into the Air Force Inspection Agency and the Air Force Safety Agency in August 1991. Reorganization of the air staff in 1992 created the Air Force Chief of Safety position, reporting directly to the Air Force Chief of Staff. The Chief of Safety became dual-hatted as the commander of the Air Force Safety Agency. In July 1993, the agency moved to Kirtland AFB due to the closure of Norton AFB.\n\r\nFollowing The Blue Ribbon Panel on Aviation Safety in 1995, the Air Force Safety Center was activated on Jan. 1, 1996, when the Air Force Chief of Safety and support staff moved from Washington, D.C., to consolidate all safety functions at Kirtland AFB. The Chief of Safety position was changed from a brigadier general to a major general.\n\r\nThe Deputy Chief of Safety/Executive Director position was created in October 2003 to oversee the daily functions of the center. The Chief of Safety and support staff moved back to the Pentagon in April 2004.\n\r\nIn February 2018, the Deputy Chief of Safety/Executive Director position was split into two positions. The Vice Commander of AFSEC would retain responsibility for overseeing daily functions at the center and the Deputy Chief of Safety would reside with the Chief of Safety in Washington, D.C.\n\r\nWith the creation of the U.S. Space Force on Dec. 20, 2019, the Air Force Safety Center ensured safety functions continued by supporting safety across two services for the Department of the Air Force. This led to the transfer of the Space Safety Division to the Space Force in November 2020, making the safety center a blended organization.\n\nPoint of Contact\r\nAir Force Safety Center Public Affairs; 9700 G Avenue SE; Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670; DSN 246-2098 or 505-846-2098.\n\nwww.safety.af.mil\n\r\n(Current as of May 2022)"

    "description": "The Air Force Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) System is a unique and significant part of the nation\u2019s mobility resources. Its mission is to provide time sensitive, mission critical en route care to patients to and between medical treatment facilities. Care is provided by Air Force medics specially trained to operate within the global AE system.\n\r\nThe end of the Cold War and the associated military downsizing resulted in a reduced forward medical presence. \u00a0Reducing theater beds created an increased dependence on the AE system. \u00a0Advanced care capability was also pushed farther forward to link casualties to life-saving medical treatment as early as possible in the care continuum.\u00a0\n\r\nAs the lead command for AE, Air Mobility Command is responsible for organizing, training and equipping the AE forces and oversees an integral system of command and control, operational and clinical training, communications, staging and patient care. The AMC/Command Surgeon (SG) is the execution agency responsible for resourcing, maintaining and recycling inflight medical equipment and patient movement items to support DOD patient movement.\n\r\nAeromedical Evacuation capability is a system of systems including ground and airborne forces providing and supporting medical care inflight and within ground patient staging platforms. \u00a0AE crews and critical care transport teams execute patient movement predominately on Mobility Air Forces aircraft, as well as on sister service, contracted, and international partner airframes. AE forces operate anywhere air operations occur in support of the full range of military operations, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapt.

This designation streamlines operational aircraft and personnel assigned to the AE squadrons under the same authority. In this capacity, A3 directs intra/inter-theater AE operations and all airlift aspects of the AE mission, establishes and implements operational training and evaluation guidance as outlined in 10- and 11-series publications and manages the operational training and standardization and evaluation. \u00a0\n\r\nThe U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (Air Force Material Command) and Air Education and Training Command provide standardized formal training for aircrew members and patient staging personnel supporting the AE mission.\u00a0\n\r\nThe Air National Guard (ANG) has nine AE squadrons and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) has a total of 18 AE squadrons. When combined with ground medical units, the Air National Guard and Reserve account for 70 percent of AE forces supporting the AE system. There are four active duty AE squadrons: two in the continental U.S. and one each in USAFE and PACAF. \u00a0Active duty AE squadrons and medical facilities provide 29 percent of the total AE capability. \u00a0Each component plays a critical role in AE mission execution during both peace and conflict. Together, AE and ground medical units across each AF component provide AE crews, specialized critical care teams, command, ground support, patient staging and infrastructure needed to establish and conduct AE mission operations.\u00a0\n\r\nPoint of Contact\u00a0\nAir Mobility Command, Office of Public Affairs, (618) 229-7843\u00a0\n\r\n(Current as of August 2014)"

    "description": "The Air National Guard is administered by the National Guard Bureau, a joint bureau of the departments of the Army and Air Force, located in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.\n\nMission \r\nThe Air National Guard has both a federal and state mission. The dual mission, a provision of the U. S. Constitution, results in each guardsman holding membership in the National Guard of his or her state and in the National Guard of the United States.\n\nFederal Mission\r\nThe Air National Guard's federal mission is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for prompt mobilization during war and provide assistance during national emergencies (such as natural disasters or civil disturbances). During peacetime, the combat-ready units and support units are assigned to most Air Force major commands to carry out missions compatible with training, mobilization readiness, humanitarian and contingency operations such as\u00a0Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Air National Guard units may be activated in a number of ways as prescribed by public law. Most of the laws may be found in Title 10 of the U.S. Code.\n\r\nThe Air National Guard provides almost half of the Air Force's tactical airlift support, combat communications functions, aeromedical evacuations and aerial refueling. In addition, the Air National Guard has total responsibility for air defense of the entire United States.\n\nState Mission\r\nWhen Air National Guard units are not mobilized or under federal control, they report to the governor of their respective state, territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands) or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard. Each of the 54 National Guard organizations is supervised by the adjutant general of the state or territory. Under state law, the Air National Guard provides protection of life, property and preserves peace, order and public safety. These missions are accomplished through emergency relief support during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and forest fires; search and rescue operations; support to civil defense authorities; maintenance of vital public services and counterdrug operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirmen from the 179th Airlift Wing Maintenance Group perform an isochronal inspection of a C-130H Hercules on Feb. 14, 2017, at the 179th Airlift Wing, Mansfield, Ohio.

(U.S. Air Force Photo by Senior Airman Jay Grabiec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForce Structure\r\nThe primary sources of full-time support for Air National Guard units are the dual-status military technician and guardsmen on active duty. These people perform day-to-day management, administration and maintenance. By law, dual-status military technicians are civil service employees of the federal government who must be military members of the unit that employs them. Technicians train with the unit and are mobilized with it when it's activated. Active-duty members serve under the command authority of their respective state or territorial governors until mobilized for federal duty. The Air National Guard has more than 106,000 officers and enlisted people who serve in\u00a089 flying units and 579 mission support units.\u00a0\n\r\nThe National Guard Bureau, both a staff and operating agency, administers the federal functions of the Army and the Air National Guard. As a staff agency, the National Guard Bureau participates with the Army and Air staffs in developing and coordinating programs that directly affect the National Guard. As an operating agency, the National Guard Bureau formulates and administers the programs for training, development and maintenance of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard and acts as the channel of communication between the Army, Air Force and the 54 states and territories where National Guard units are located.\n\nPersonnel and Resources\r\nThe authorized strength for the Air National Guard for the current fiscal year is 106,700. The operating budget for this fiscal year is $3,022 million for personnel, $6,182 million for operation and maintenance, for a total of\u00a0 $9, 204 million.\u00a0\n\nFlying Units/Functions and Capabilities \r\nBesides maintaining 94 percent of the U.S. alert sites for air defense, the Air National Guard flew more than 1,300 sorties in\u00a0fiscal 2010 to protect U.S. air sovereignty while still performing many other Air Force-related roles and missions.\n\r\nThe Air National Guard provides tactical airlift, air refueling tankers, general purpose fighters, rescue and recovery capabilities, tactical air support, weather flights, strategic airlift, special operations capabilities and aeromedical evacuation units.\n\r\nAirlift squadrons fly C-130 Hercules, C-5 Galaxy, and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft that transport people, equipment and supplies. Air refueling units, flying KC-135 Stratotankers, provide air-to-air refueling for strategic and tactical aircraft.\n\r\nThe Air National Guard has three rescue and recovery squadrons that fly HH-60 helicopters and HC-130 aircraft. These units provide important lifesaving capabilities and services to civilian and military agencies. Air support units that fly A-10C Thunderbolt IIs provide forward air control support of close-air support missions. The general-purpose fighter force is equipped with F-22 Raptor, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and\u00a0A-10 aircraft.\u00a0\n\nSupport Unit Functions and Capabilities\r\nSupport units are essential to the Air Force mission. In the Air National Guard they include air traffic control units, combat communications squadrons, civil engineering and communication flights and squadrons. Support units also include weather flights, aircraft control and warning squadrons, a range control squadron and an electronic security unit.\n\r\nAir National Guard weather flights provide weather support to Air Force and Army National Guard and Army Reserve divisions and brigades. During mobilization or federal call up, weather flight units are under the Air Combat Command, except for one, which falls under\u00a0Pacific Air Forces.\n\r\nCivil engineer squadrons provide engineer and firefighter forces trained and equipped to deploy on short notice. Other civil engineer squadrons provide self-sufficient, deployable civil engineer teams to perform heavy repair and maintenance on air bases and remote sites.\n\r\nAerial port units provide trained people to support Air Mobility Command's two major theater war commitments. They deploy to 20 active-duty aerial port locations worldwide for annual tour training.\n\r\nMedical units located with parent flying organizations provide day-to-day health care for flying and non-flying people during their two-week annual training period or during monthly two-day unit training assemblies."

    "description": "The Army & Air Force Exchange Service (the Exchange) has an enduring mission to provide quality merchandise and services to its customers at competitively low prices and to generate earnings which provide a dividend to support morale, welfare and recreation programs.\n\nORGANIZATION\r\nThe Exchange is a joint non-appropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense (DoD) and provides quality merchandise and services to active duty, Guard and Reserve members, military retirees and their families at competitively low prices. The Exchange is now in its 117th year. Shopping the Exchange offers an average overall savings of 25 percent compared to shopping the competition. The Exchange returned $203 million to the military services in 2011. Shoppers can enjoy Exchange benefits in many ways, with the greatest value being the Exchange pledge \"We go where you go,\" serving troops worldwide.\n\nVISION\r\nTo be our customers' first choice.\n\nMILITARY SUPPORT\r\nWhen military members deploy to remote locations around the world, the Exchange is with them, offering products and services to bring troops a taste of home. The Exchange also supports deployed troops with programs such as gift and phone cards. These programs allow any American to show their support to military members worldwide.\n\neCOMMERCE\r\nThe Exchange is a multi-channel retailer, offering products to authorized customers via retail stores, online and mobile shopping. More than 18 million items are available through the Exchange Online Store and Online Mall. The Exchange supports an extremely mobile customer base. The Internet provides the ability to extend the Exchange benefit to authorized shoppers worldwide, regardless of where they are located.\n\nSOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT\r\nThe Exchange is a major source of employment for military families. Approximately 23 percent of the more than 42,000 Exchange Associates are military family members; 10 percent are veterans; two percent are active-duty or Reserve personnel working part-time in Exchanges during their off-duty hours.\n\nSALES AND DIVIDENDS\r\nRoughly two-thirds of the Exchange's earnings are paid to Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM G-9) and Air Force Services programs. In the past ten years, the Exchange has contributed more than $2.4 billion to quality-of-life improvements including youth services, Armed Forces, Recreation Centers, arts and crafts, aquatic centers, golf courses and more. In addition to funding morale welfare and services programs, Exchange earnings also go toward building new stores or renovating existing facilities. Construction funds for these new or replacement facilities come entirely from the sale of merchandise and services. Revenues in FY '11 totaled $10.3 billion, including $1.6 billion in concession sales. Earnings totaled more than $277 million. Dividends to the services were:\r\n$121.3M to the Army\r\n$68.8M to the Air Force\r\n$12.1M to the Marine Corps\r\n$1.1M to the Navy\r\nFor 2011, the Exchange paid a per capita dividend of $212 for every Soldier and Airman.\n\nHISTORY\r\nDuring the American Revolution, the military did not issue personal items such as soap, razors, and tobacco to soldiers. However, peddlers -- called sutlers -- followed the Army and sold merchandise, most of it inferior. Because of its corruption, traders authorized to sell merchandise at each post replaced the sutler system in 1867. By 1889, the War Department authorized canteens, putting traders out of business.\n\r\nOn July 25, 1895, General Order No. 46 set the standard for the concept and mission of today's Exchange Service. Eventually, independent operations evolved at Army divisional levels. Large posts, with little or no direction from higher headquarters, established a post exchange to serve their unit. Post commanders decided how to spend earnings. The system remained basically unchanged until 1941, when the War Department established the Army Exchange Service to provide broad guidance for worldwide operations. When the Air Force became a separate service, the Exchange became a joint operation. In 1948, the organization became the Army and Air Force Exchange Service.\n\nFACILITIES WORLDWIDE\r\nThe Exchange is responsible for more than 3,700 facilities worldwide in more than 30 countries, 50 states and five U.S. territories. The Exchange operates 157 main stores, 182 Military Clothing facilities, over 1,000 specialty stores (gas stations, bookstores, Class Six, etc.) and more than 120 theaters. Plus the Exchange has more than 2,100 fast food restaurants, such as Taco Bell, Burger King and Subway. Concession operations overseen by the Exchange add nearly 6,000 more activities.

    "title": "B-1B Lancer",
    "description": "Mission\r\nCarrying the largest conventional payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory, the multi-mission B-1 is the backbone of America's long-range bomber force. It can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time.\nFeatures\r\nThe B-1B's blended wing/body configuration, variable-geometry wings and turbofan afterburning engines, combine to provide long range, maneuverability and high speed while enhancing survivability. Forward wing settings are used for takeoff, landings, air refueling and in some high-altitude weapons employment scenarios. Aft wing sweep settings - the main combat configuration -- are typically used during high subsonic and supersonic flight, enhancing the B-1B's maneuverability in the low- and high-altitude regimes. The B-1B's speed and superior handling characteristics allow it to seamlessly integrate in mixed force packages. These capabilities, when combined with its substantial payload, excellent radar targeting system, long loiter time and survivability, make the B-1B a key element of any joint/composite strike force.\nThe B-1 is a highly versatile, multi-mission weapon system. The B-1B's synthetic aperture radar is capable of tracking, targeting and engaging moving vehicles as well as self-targeting and terrain-following modes. In addition, an extremely accurate Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System enables aircrews to navigate without the aid of ground-based navigation aids as well as engage targets with a high level of precision. The addition of a fully integrated data link (FIDL) with Link-16 capability provides improved battlefield situation awareness and secure beyond line of sight reach back connectivity.\u00a0 In a time sensitive targeting environment, the aircrew can use targeting data received from the Combined Air Operations Center or other command and control assets to strike emerging targets rapidly and efficiently.\nThe B-1B's onboard self-protection electronic jamming equipment, radar warning receiver (ALQ-161) and expendable countermeasures (chaff and flare) system and a towed decoy system (ALE-50) complements its low-radar cross-section to form an integrated, robust defense system that supports penetration of hostile airspace. The ALQ-161 electronic countermeasures system detects and identifies the full spectrum of adversary threat emitters then applies the appropriate jamming technique either automatically or through operator inputs.\nCurrent modifications build on this foundation. Radar sustainability and capability upgrades will provide a more reliable system and may be upgraded in the future to include an ultra high-resolution capability and automatic target recognition. The addition of Link-16 and FIDL combined with associated cockpit upgrades will provide the crew with a much more flexible, integrated cockpit, and will allow the B-1 to operate in the fast-paced integrated battlefield of the future. Several obsolete and hard to maintain electronic systems are also being replaced to improve aircraft reliability.\nBackground\r\nThe B-1A was initially developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the B-52. Four prototypes of this long-range, high speed (Mach 2.2) strategic bomber were developed and tested in the mid-1970s, but the program was canceled in 1977 before going into production. Flight testing continued through 1981.\nThe B-1B is an improved variant initiated by the Reagan administration in 1981. Major changes included and additional structure to increase payload by 74,000 pounds, an improved radar and reduction of the radar cross section by an order of magnitude. The inlet was extensively modified as part of this RCS reduction, necessitating a reduction in maximum speed to Mach 1.2.\nThe first production B-1 flew in October 1984, and the first B-1B was delivered to Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, in June 1985. Initial operational capability was achieved on Oct. 1, 1986. The final B-1B was delivered May 2, 1988.\nThe United States eliminated the nuclear mission for the B-1 in 1994. Even though the Air Force expended no further funding to maintain nuclear capabilities, the B-1 was still considered a heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armament until 2007. The conversion to conventional only began in November 2007 under the original START treaty and was completed in March 2011 under the New START treaty. To make that conversion possible, two steps were taken:\nDuring the first step a metal cylindrical sleeve was welded into the aft attachment point of each set of B-1 pylon attachments. This prevented installing B-1 Air Launched Cruise Missile pylons.\nDuring the second step two nuclear armament-unique cable connectors in each of the B-1 weapons bays were removed. This prevented the pre-arm signal from reaching the weapons.\nThe B-1B holds almost 50 world records for speed, payload, range, and time of climb in its class. The National Aeronautic Association recognized the B-1B for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994. The most recent records were made official in 2004.\nThe B-1B was first used in combat in support of operations against Iraq during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. In 1999, six B-1s were used in Operation Allied Force, delivering more than 20 percent of the total ordnance while flying less than 2 percent of the combat sorties.\nDuring the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped nearly 40 percent of the total tonnage delivered by coalition air forces. This included nearly 3,900 JDAMs, or 67 percent of the total. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, the aircraft flew less than 1 percent of the combat missions while delivering 43 percent of the JDAMs used. The B-1 continues to be deployed today, flying missions daily in support of continuing operations.\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function:\u00a0Long-range, multi-role, heavy bomber\nContractor:\u00a0Boeing, North America (formerly Rockwell International, North American Aircraft); Offensive avionics, Boeing Military Airplane; Defensive Avionics, EDO Corporation\nPower plant:\u00a0Four General Electric F101-GE-102 turbofan engine with afterburner\nThrust:\u00a030,000-plus pounds with afterburner, per engine\nWingspan:\u00a0137 feet (41.8 meters) extended forward, 79 feet (24.1 meters) swept aft\nLength:\u00a0146 feet (44.5 meters)\nHeight:\u00a034 feet (10.4 meters)\nWeight:\u00a0approximately 190,000 pounds (86,183 kilograms)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight:\u00a0477,000 pounds (216,634 kilograms)\nFuel Capacity:\u00a0265,274 pounds (120,326 kilograms)\nPayload:\u00a075,000 pounds (34,019 kilograms)\nSpeed:\u00a0900-plus mph (Mach 1.2 at sea level)\nRange:\u00a0Intercontinental\nCeiling:\u00a0More than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters)\nArmament:\u00a084 500-pound Mk-82 or 24 2,000-pound\u00a0 Mk-84 general purpose bombs; up to 84 500-pound Mk-62 or 8 2,000-pound Mk-65 Quick Strike naval mines; 30 cluster munitions (CBU-87, -89, -97) or 30 Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispensers (CBU-103, -104, -105); up to 24 2,000-pound GBU-31 or 15 500-pound GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions; up to 24 AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles; 15 GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions\nCrew:\u00a0Four (aircraft commander, copilot, and two combat systems officers)\nUnit Cost: $317 million\nInitial operating capability:\u00a0 October 1986\nInventory:\u00a0Active force, 62 (test, 2); ANG, 0; Reserve, 0\n(Current as of September 2016)\n\u00a0\nPoint of Contact\nAir Force Global Strike Command, Public Affairs Office; 245 Davis Avenue East, Suite 198; Barksdale AFB, LA 71110; DSN 781-1305 or 318-456-1305; e-mail:\u00a0afgsc.paworkflow@us.af.mil"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe B-2 Spirit is a multi-role bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. A dramatic leap forward in technology, the bomber represents a major milestone in the U.S. bomber modernization program. The B-2 brings massive firepower to bear, in a short time, anywhere on the globe through previously impenetrable defenses.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe B-2 provides the penetrating flexibility and effectiveness inherent in manned bombers. Its low-observable, or \"stealth,\" characteristics give it the unique ability to penetrate an enemy's most sophisticated defenses and threaten its most valued, and heavily defended, targets. Its capability to penetrate air defenses and threaten effective retaliation provides a strong, effective deterrent and combat force well into the 21st century.\n\r\nThe revolutionary blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 important advantages over existing bombers. Its low-observability provides it greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing its range and a better field of view for the aircraft's sensors. Its unrefueled range is approximately 6,000 nautical miles (9,600 kilometers).\n\r\nThe B-2's low observability is derived from a combination of reduced infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic, visual and radar signatures. These signatures make it difficult for the sophisticated defensive systems to detect, track and engage the B-2. Many aspects of the low-observability process remain classified; however, the B-2's composite materials, special coatings and flying-wing design all contribute to its \"stealthiness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA B-2 Spirit lands at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, on Sunday, April 30, 2006.

Its first flight was July 17, 1989. The B-2 Combined Test Force, Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California, is responsible for flight testing the engineering, manufacturing and development aircraft on the B-2.\n\r\nWhiteman AFB, Missouri, is the only operational base for the B-2. The first aircraft, Spirit of Missouri, was delivered Dec. 17, 1993. Depot maintenance responsibility for the B-2 is performed by Air Force contractor support and is managed at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker AFB, Okla.\n\r\nThe combat effectiveness of the B-2 was proved in Operation Allied Force, where it was responsible for destroying 33 percent of all Serbian targets in the first eight weeks, by flying nonstop to Kosovo from its home base in Missouri and back. In support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-2 flew one of its longest missions to date from Whiteman to Afghanistan and back. The B-2 completed its first-ever combat deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, flying 22 sorties from a forward operating location as well as 27 sorties from Whiteman AFB and releasing more than 1.5 million pounds of munitions. The aircraft received full operational capability status in December 2003.

Targeting pods provide improved long-range target detection, identification and continuous stabilized surveillance for all missions, including close air support of ground forces. The advanced targeting and image processing technology significantly increases the combat effectiveness of the B-52 during day, night and less than ideal weather conditions when attacking ground targets with a variety of standoff weapons (e.g., laser-guided bombs, conventional bombs and GPS-guided weapons).\n\r\nThe use of aerial refueling gives the B-52 a range limited only by aircrew endurance. It has an unrefueled combat range in excess of 8,800 miles (14,080 kilometers).\n\nBackground\r\nFor more than 60 years, B-52s have been the backbone of the strategic bomber force for the United States. The B-52 is capable of dropping or launching the widest array of weapons in the U.S. inventory. This includes gravity bombs, cluster bombs, precision guided missiles and joint direct attack munitions. Updated with modern technology, the B-52 is capable of delivering the full complement of joint developed weapons and will continue into the 21st century as an important element of our nation's defenses. The Air Force currently expects to operate B-52s through 2050.\n\r\nThe B-52A first flew in 1954, and the B model entered service in 1955. A total of 744 B-52s were built, with the last, a B-52H, delivered in October 1962. The first of 102 B-52H's was delivered to Strategic Air Command in May 1961. The H model can carry up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles. In addition, it can carry conventional cruise missiles that were launched in several contingencies starting in the 1990s with Operation Desert Storm and culminating with Operation Inherent Resolve in 2016.\n\r\nThe aircraft's flexibility was evident in Operation Desert Storm and again during Operation Allied Force. B-52s struck wide-area troop concentrations, fixed installations and bunkers, and decimated the morale of Iraq's Republican Guard. On Sept. 2-3, 1996, two B-52Hs struck Baghdad power stations and communications facilities with 13 AGM-86C Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, or CALCMs, as part of Operation Desert Strike. At that time, this was the longest distance flown for a combat mission involving a 34-hour, 16,000-statute-mile round trip from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana.\n\r\nIn 2001, the B-52 contributed to the success of Operation Enduring Freedom, providing the ability to loiter high above the battlefield and provide close air support through the use of precision guided munitions. The B-52 also played a role in Operation Iraqi Freedom by launching approximately 100 CALCMs during a night mission March 21, 2003.\n\r\nIn 2016, the B-52 returned to the Central Command area of responsibility for the first time in a decade. B-52s flew approximately 1,800 combat sorties against ISIS forces in Syria and Iraq contributing to the decline of ISIS in the region.\n\r\nOnly the H model is still in the Air Force inventory and is assigned to the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot AFB, North Dakota, and the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, which fall under Air Force Global Strike Command. The aircraft is also assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command's 307th Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function: Heavy bomber\nContractor: Boeing Military Airplane Co.\nPower plant: Eight Pratt & Whitney engines TF33-P-3/103 turbofan\nThrust: Each engine up to 17,000 pounds\nWingspan: 185 feet (56.4 meters)\nLength: 159 feet, 4 inches (48.5 meters)\nHeight: 40 feet, 8 inches (12.4 meters)\nWeight: Approximately 185,000 pounds (83,250 kilograms)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 488,000 pounds (219,600 kilograms)\nFuel Capacity: 312,197 pounds (141,610 kilograms)\nPayload: 70,000 pounds (31,500 kilograms)\nSpeed: 650 miles per hour (Mach 0.84)\nRange: 8,800 miles (7,652 nautical miles)\nCeiling: 50,000 feet (15,151.5 meters)\nArmament: Approximately 70,000 pounds (31,500 kilograms) mixed ordnance\u2014bombs, mines and missiles.

    "description": "Mission\nThe C-130 Hercules primarily performs the tactical portion of the airlift mission. The aircraft is capable of operating from rough, dirt strips and is the prime transport for airdropping troops and equipment into hostile areas. The C-130 operates throughout the U.S. Air Force, serving with Air Mobility Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Combat Command, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Pacific Air Forces, Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve Command, fulfilling a wide range of operational missions in both peace and war situations. Basic and specialized versions of the aircraft airframe perform a diverse number of roles, including airlift support, Antarctic ice resupply, aeromedical missions, weather reconnaissance, aerial spray missions, firefighting duties for the U.S. Forest Service and natural disaster relief missions.\nFeatures\nUsing its aft loading ramp and door, the C-130 can accommodate a wide variety of oversized cargo, including everything from utility helicopters and six-wheeled armored vehicles to standard palletized cargo and military personnel. In an aerial delivery role, it can airdrop loads up to 42,000 pounds or use its high-flotation landing gear to land and deliver cargo on rough, dirt strips.\nThe flexible design of the Hercules enables it to be configured for many different missions, allowing one aircraft to perform the role of many. Much of the special mission equipment added to the Hercules is removable, allowing the aircraft to return to its cargo delivery role if desired. Additionally, the C-130 can be rapidly reconfigured for the various types of cargo such as palletized equipment, floor-loaded material, airdrop platforms, container delivery system bundles, vehicles and personnel or aeromedical evacuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA C-130 Hercules from the 153d Airlift Wing, Wyoming Air National Guard, flies over the state of Wyoming in appreciation for essential personnel on the front lines of COVID-19 on May 15, 2020.

The C-130J incorporates state-of-the-art technology, which reduces manpower requirements, lowers operating and support costs, and provides life-cycle cost savings over earlier C-130 models. Compared to older C-130s, the J model climbs faster and higher, flies farther at a higher cruise speed, and takes off and lands in a shorter distance. The C-130J-30 is a stretch version, adding 15 feet to the fuselage, increasing usable space in the cargo compartment.\nC-130J/J-30 major system improvements include advanced two-pilot flight station with fully integrated digital avionics, color multifunctional liquid crystal and head-up displays and state-of-the-art navigation that includes a dual inertial navigation system and GPS. The aircraft also features fully integrated defensive systems, low-power color radar, digital moving map display, new turboprop engines with six-bladed all-composite propellers and a digital auto pilot. The C-130J/J-30 also includes improved fuel, environmental and ice-protection and an enhanced cargo-handling system.\nBackground\nThe Air Force issued its original design specification in 1951, yet the remarkable C-130 remains in production. The initial production model was the C-130A, with four Allison T56-A-11 or -9 turboprop engines. A total of 219 were ordered and deliveries began in December 1956. The C-130B introduced Allison T56-A-7 turboprop engines and the first of 134 entered Air Force service in May 1959.\nIntroduced in August of 1962, the 389 C-130Es that were ordered using the same Allison T56-A-7 engine, but added two 1,290 gallon external fuel tanks and an increased maximum takeoff weight capability. June 1974 introduced the first of 308 C-130Hs with the more powerful Allison T56-A-15 turboprop engine. Nearly identical to the C-130E externally, the new engine brought major performance improvements to the aircraft.\nThe latest C-130 to be produced, the C-130J, entered the inventory in February 1999. With the noticeable difference of a six-bladed composite propeller coupled to a Rolls-Royce AE2100D3 turboprop engine, the C-130J brings substantial performance improvements over all previous models. The C-130J-30, a stretch version with a 15-foot fuselage extension, increases the capabilities even more. To date, the Air Force has taken delivery of 121 C-130J aircraft from Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company.\nActive-duty locations for the C-130 and its variations are Dyess Air Force Base, Texas; Little Rock AFB, Arkansas; Ramstein Air Base, Germany; and Yokota AB, Japan.\nAir Force Reserve locations for assigned C-130 models are Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia; Keesler AFB, Mississippi; Maxwell AFB, Alabama; Minnesota-St. Paul Joint Air Reserve Station, Minnesota; Peterson AFB, Colorado; and Youngstown ARS, Ohio.\nAir National Guard locations for the C-130 and its variations are Bradley Air National Guard Base, Connecticut; \u00a0Joint Reserve Base Carswell, Texas; Channel Island ANG Station, California; Cheyenne Municipal Airport, Wyoming; Great Falls ANGB, Montana; Little Rock AFB, Arkansas; Louisville IAP, Kentucky; Mansfield Lahm ANG Base, Ohio; \u00a0Minnesota-St. Paul ARS, Minnesota; \u00a0Mu\u00f1iz ANGB, Puerto Rico; New Castle County ANGB, Delaware; Greater Peoria Regional Airport, Illinois; Quonset State Airport, Rhode Island; Reno-Tahoe IAP, Nevada; Savannah IAP, Georgia; Schenectady MAP, New York; Rosecrans Memorial Airport, Missouri; and Yeager Airport, West Virginia.\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function: Global airlift\nContractor: Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company\nPower Plant:\nC-130E: Four Allison T56-A-7 turboprops; 4,200 prop shaft horsepower\nC-130H: Four Allison T56-A-15 turboprops; 4,591prop shaft horsepower\nC-130J: Four Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprops; 4,700 horsepower\nLength: C-130E/H/J: 97 feet, 9 inches (29.3 meters)\nC-130J-30: 112 feet, 9 inches (34.69 meters)\nHeight: 38 feet, 10 inches (11. 9 meters)\nWingspan: 132 feet, 7 inches (39.7 meters)\nCargo Compartment: \nC-130E/H/J: length, 41 feet (12.5 meters); width, 123 inches (meters); height, 9 feet (2.74 meters).

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe C-17 Globemaster III is the most flexible cargo aircraft to enter the airlift force. The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward bases in the deployment area. The aircraft can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations. The inherent flexibility and performance of the C-17 force improve the ability of the total airlift system to fulfill the worldwide air mobility requirements of the United States.\nThe ultimate measure of airlift effectiveness is the ability to rapidly project and sustain an effective combat force close to a potential battle area. Threats to U.S. interests have changed in recent years, and the size and weight of U.S.-mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in response to improved capabilities of potential adversaries. This trend has significantly increased air mobility requirements, particularly in the area of large or heavy outsize cargo. As a result, newer and more flexible airlift aircraft are needed to meet potential armed contingencies, peacekeeping or humanitarian missions worldwide. The C-17 is capable of meeting today's demanding airlift missions.\nFeatures\r\nReliability and maintainability are two outstanding benefits of the C-17 system. Current operational requirements impose demanding reliability and maintainability. These requirements include an aircraft mission completion success probability rate of 92 percent, only 20 aircraft maintenance man-hours per flying hour, and full and partial mission availability rates of 74.7 and 82.5 percent, respectively. The Boeing warranty assures these figures will be met.\nThe C-17 measures 174 feet long (53 meters) with a wingspan of 169 feet, 10 inches (51.75 meters). The aircraft is powered by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines, which are based on the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757. Each engine is rated at 40,440 pounds of thrust and includes thrust reversers that direct the flow of air upward and forward to avoid ingestion of dust and debris.\u00a0 Additionally, thrust reversers provide enough thrust to reverse the aircraft while taxing backwards and create in-flight drag for maximum rate descents.\u00a0\u00a0 The design characteristics give it the capability to operate into and out of short runways and austere airfields carrying large payloads. \u00a0Maximum use has been made of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, including Air Force-standardized avionics.\nThe aircraft is operated by a crew of three (pilot, co-pilot and loadmaster), reducing manpower requirements, risk exposure and long-term operating costs. Cargo is loaded onto the C-17 through a large aft ramp and door system that accommodates virtually all of the Army\u2019s air-transportable equipment such as a 69-ton M1 Abrams main battle tank, armored vehicles, trucks and trailers. Additionally, the cargo floor has rollers that can be flipped from a flat floor to accommodate wheeled or tracked vehicles to rollerized conveyers to accommodate palletized cargo.\u00a0 The C-17 is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers with their accompanying equipment.\nMaximum payload capacity of the C-17 is 170,900 pounds (77,519 kilograms), and its maximum gross takeoff weight is 585,000 pounds (265,352 kilograms). With a payload of 164,900 pounds (74,797 kilograms) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000 feet (8,534 meters), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of approximately 2,400 nautical miles. Its cruise speed is approximately 450 knots (.74 Mach).\nThe design of the aircraft (high-lift wing, slats, and externally blown flaps) allows it to operate through small, austere airfields. The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). Even on such narrow runways, the C-17 can turn around using a three-point star turn and its backing capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-17 Globemaster III taxis to the ramp at Balad Air Base.  The aircraft can perform tactical air lift and air drop missions and can also transport litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations during Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Details\n /\r\n                \nDownload Hi-Res\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA C-17 Globemaster III from the 301st Airlift Squadron, 349th Air Mobility Wing, Travis Air Force Base, Calif., is refueled by a KC-10 Extender, July 20, 2017.

    "description": "The C-20 was retired Aug. 30, 2017.\nMission\nThe C-20 is a twin-engine, turbofan aircraft acquired to fill the airlift mission for high-ranking government and Department of Defense officials. The 89th Airlift Wing, Joint Base Andrews, Md., operates five C-20Bs for worldwide special air missions. The 86th Airlift Wing, Ramstein Air Base, Germany, operates two C-20Hs for operational support airlift missions.\nFeatures \r\nTwo Rolls Royce Spey Mark 511-8 engines power the C-20B models. The primary difference between the C-20B and H models is the electrical system, engines, and the avionics package. Two Rolls Royce Tay Mark 611-8 engines power the C-20H. These engines provide greater performance, greater range and have a reduced noise signature compared to the B model. The C-20H is also slightly longer than the B model, and has an upgraded avionics package and interior. Worldwide secure and non-secure passenger communication capability exists on both aircraft.\n\nBackground \r\nThe C-20A/B, military versions of the Gulfstream III, was chosen in June 1983 as the replacement aircraft for the C-140B Jetstar. Three A models were delivered to the 89th Airlift Wing under a cost-saving accelerated purchase plan. Upon delivery of the C-20Bs, Andrews transferred the three C-20As to Ramstein Air Base and all C-140Bs at both locations were phased out of the U.S. Air Force inventory. In 1992, Gulfstream delivered their latest model, the C-20H (Gulfstream IV) to Andrews AFB.

C-21s stationed outside the continental United States, or CONUS, were assigned to the theater commanders. Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the lead command for the aircraft.\n\r\nIn April 1997, the majority of CONUS-based C-21s were consolidated within the 375th Airlift Wing at Scott AFB, while the National Guard Bureau maintained several aircraft at Peterson AFB, Colorado, Air Force Flight Standards Agency maintained several aircraft at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland and Air Education and Training Command maintained several aircraft at Keesler AFB, Mississippi.\n\r\nIn January 2007, Program Budget Decision number 720 reduced C-21 operations to 40 aircraft. AMC dissolved C-21 operations at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. U.S. Air Forces in Europe was reduced from 13 to 10, Pacific Air Forces from four to three and AETC from five to three.\n\r\nThe NGB picked up 19 aircraft for \u2018bridge\u2019 missions at Fargo, North Dakota, Battle Creek, Michigan, and Bradley Air National Guard Base, Connecticut, until they received C-27 aircraft. Base Realignment and Closure actions moved the AFFSA C-21s from Joint Base Andrews to Will Rogers World Airport, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In June 2007, Pacific Air Forces divested itself of its three C-21s, the NGB gaining them.\n\r\nIn 2010, Resource Management Decision 700, or RMD 700, cut the number of C-21 aircraft from 56 to 28. Also in line with RMD 700, AETC closed the flight training unit located at Keesler AFB, Mississippi.\n\r\nBeginning in 2018, the C-21 fleet in the United States began further consolidation efforts from Peterson AFB, Joint Base Andrews, moving all CONUS-based C-21s to Scott AFB\u2019s 458th Airlift Squadron via the National Defense Authorization Acts of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal 2019.\nThese consolidation efforts leave Scott AFB\u2019s 458th Airlift Squadron (AMC) and Ramstein Air Base, Germany\u2019s 76th Airlift Squadron (USAFE) as the remaining force of C-21s.

The C-40B's primary customers are the combatant commanders, and the C-40C customers include members of the Cabinet and Congress. The aircraft also performs other operational support missions.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe C-40 B/C is based upon the commercial Boeing 737-700 business jet. The body of the C-40 is identical to that of the Boeing 737-700, but has winglets. Both models have state of the art avionics equipment, integrated GPS and flight management system/electronic flight instrument system and a heads-up display. Heading the safety equipment list is the traffic collision avoidance system and enhanced weather radar. The aircraft is a variant of the Boeing next generation 737-700, and combines the 737-700 fuselage with the wings and landing gear from the larger and heavier 737-800. The basic aircraft has auxiliary fuel tanks, a specialized interior with self-sustainment features and managed passenger communications.\n\r\nThe cabin area is equipped with a crew rest area, distinguished visitor compartment with sleep accommodations, two galleys and business class seating with worktables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA C-40 flies on final approach before landing, Oct. 21, 2017, at Travis Air Force Base, Calif.

Communications are paramount aboard the C-40B which provides broadband data/video transmit and receive capability as well as clear and secure voice and data communication. It gives combatant commanders the ability to conduct business anywhere around the world using on-board internet and local area network connections, improved telephones, satellites, television monitors, and facsimile and copy machines. The C-40B also has a computer-based passenger data system.\n\r\nThe C-40C is not equipped with the advanced communications capability of the C-40B. Unique to the C-40C is the capability to change its configuration to accommodate from 42 to 111 passengers.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Air Force selected the C-40B, a military version of the Boeing 737-700 business jet, to replace the aging fleet of C-137 aircraft for U.S. combatant commanders. The Air Force awarded the medium lift contract in August 2000.\n\r\nBy using commercial, off-the-shelf acquisition practices and a new lease program for the C-40C model, the Air Force reached a benchmark for aircraft procurement. The C-40C was the first military aircraft to be purchased in this manner. The 201st Airlift Squadron, Washington, D.C. National Guard, acquired two C-40C aircraft in October 2002.\n\r\nThe C-40C is intended to replace the aging C-22. The 89th Airlift Wing received its first C-40B aircraft in December 2002. Both units are based at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.\n\r\nThe 15th Airlift Wing, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, acquired its C-40B for U.S. Pacific Command in February 2003. The 932d Airlift Wing, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, received three C-40C aircraft in 2007.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function: High-priority personnel transport\nPrime Contractor: Boeing (airframe) and CFM International (engines)\nPower Plant: Two GE CFM 56-7B27 turbofan engines\nThrust: 27,000 pounds static thrust each engine\nLength: 110 feet, 4 inches (33.6 meters)\nHeight: 41 feet, 2 inches (12.5 meters)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 171,000 pounds\nWingspan: 117 feet, 5 inches (35.8 meters)\nCruise Speed: 322 mph\nCeiling: 41,000 feet (12,727 meters)\nFuel Capability: 60,000 pounds\nMaximum Range: 4,500 to 5,000 nautical miles (based on payload) unrefueled range\nMaximum Load: C-40B: 26 to 32 passengers; C-40C: 42 to 111 passengers\nCrew: 10 (varies with model and mission)\nDate Deployed: Feb. 28, 2003\nUnit Cost: $70 million\nInventory: Active force, 4; Air National Guard, 3; Air Force Reserve, 4\n\r\n(Current as of April 2020)"

Selected aircraft from U.S. airlines, contractually committed to CRAF, augment Department of Defense airlift requirements in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft.\u00a0\n\r\nThe CRAF has two main segments: international and national. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections and the national segment satisfies domestic requirements. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the performance characteristics needed.\u00a0\n\r\nThe long-range international section consists of passenger and cargo aircraft capable of transoceanic operations. The role of these aircraft is to augment the Air Mobility Command's long-range intertheater C-5s and C-17s during periods of increased airlift needs, from minor contingencies up through full national defense emergencies.\u00a0\n\r\nMedium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore and select intra-theater airlift requirements.\n\r\nThe airlines contractually pledge aircraft to the various segments of CRAF, ready for activation when needed. To provide incentives for civil carriers to commit aircraft to the CRAF program and to assure the United States of adequate airlift reserves, the government makes peacetime DOD airlift business available to civilian airlines that offer aircraft to the CRAF.

Aircraft committed must be U.S.-registered and carriers must commit and maintain at least four complete crews for each aircraft.\n\r\nCarriers with aircraft whose performance does not meet minimum CRAF requirements are issued a certificate of technical ineligibility so they can still compete for government airlift business.\u00a0\n\r\nAs of June 2014, 24 carriers and 553 aircraft are enrolled in CRAF. This includes 517 aircraft in the international segment with 391 in the long-range international section and 126 in the short-range international section. There are 36 aircraft in the national segment. These numbers are subject to change on a monthly basis.\u00a0\n\r\nThree stages of incremental activation allow for tailoring an airlift force suitable for the contingency at hand. Stage I is for minor regional crises and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HADR) efforts, Stage II would be used for major theater war and Stage III for periods of national mobilization.\u00a0\n\r\nThe commander, U.S. Transportation Command, with approval of the Secretary of Defense, is the activation authority for all three stages of CRAF. During a crisis, if AMC has a need for additional aircraft, it would request the commander of USTRANSCOM to take steps to activate the appropriate CRAF stage.\u00a0\n\r\nEach stage of the CRAF activation is only used to the extent necessary to provide the amount of civil augmentation airlift needed by DOD. When notified of call-up, the carrier response time to have its aircraft ready for a CRAF mission is 24 to 48 hours after AMC assigns the mission, depending on which CRAF stage is activated. The air carriers continue to operate and maintain the aircraft with their resources; however, AMC controls the aircraft missions.\n\r\nSafety is the paramount concern, and numerous procedures are in effect to ensure that the air carriers with which AMC contracts afford the highest level of safety to DOD passengers. Prior to receiving a contract, all carriers must demonstrate that they have provided substantially equivalent and comparable commercial service for one year before submitting their offer to fly for the Defense Department. All carriers must be fully certified Federal Aviation Administration carriers and meet the stringent standards of FAA regulations pertaining to commercial airlines (FAR Part 121).\n\r\nA DOD survey team, composed of experienced pilots and skilled maintenance personnel, performs an on-site inspection of the carriers. This team conducts a comprehensive inspection that includes the carrier's aircraft, training facilities, crew qualifications, maintenance procedures and quality control practices. After passing this survey, the Commercial Airlift Review Board approves the carrier to provide charter airlift services before receiving a contract.\u00a0\n\r\nThe DOD Commercial Airlift Division continues to monitor the carrier's safety record, operations and maintenance status, contract performance, financial condition and management initiatives, summarizing significant trends in a comprehensive review every six months. In addition to this in-depth review, there are several other surveillance initiatives. These include safety preflight inspections of commercial aircraft by DOD designated inspectors and periodic cockpit observations on operational flights by highly experienced pilots from AMC's DOD Commercial Airlift Division. This Division maintains close coordination with the FAA for the flow of information on all DOD approved carriers.\n\r\nThe following air carriers are members of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (subject to change monthly)\u00a0\n\nInternational Segment - Long Range Section:\u00a0\r\nABX Air\u00a0\r\nAir Transport International\u00a0\r\nAmerican Airlines\u00a0\r\nAtlas Air\u00a0\r\nDelta Air Lines\u00a0\r\nFederal Express Airlines\u00a0\r\nHawaiian Airlines\u00a0\r\nKalitta Air Cargo\r\nNational Air Cargo Group dba National Airlines\u00a0\r\nOmni Air International\u00a0\r\nPolar Air Cargo\u00a0\r\nSky Lease I\r\nSouthern Air\u00a0\r\nUnited Air Lines\u00a0\r\nUnited Parcel Service\r\nUS Airways\u00a0\n\nInternational Segment - Short Range Section:\u00a0\r\nAlaska Airlines\u00a0\r\nAmerican Airlines\r\nDelta Air Lines\u00a0\r\nJet Blue Airways\r\nLynden Air Cargo\u00a0\r\nMiami Air International\u00a0\r\nMN Airlines dba Sun Country\r\nNorthern Air Cargo\u00a0\r\nUnited Air Lines\n\nNational Segment - Domestic Section:\u00a0\r\nAllegiant Air\r\nSouthwest Airlines\u00a0\n\nPoint of Contact\u00a0\nAir Mobility Command, Public Affairs Office; 402 Scott Drive, Unit 1-M-8; Scott AFB, Ill. 62225-5335;\r\nDSN 779-7843 or (618) 229-7843.\u00a0\r\nemail: amc-pao@us.af.mil\n\r\n(Current as of July 2014)"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe E-3 Sentry is an airborne warning and control system, or AWACS, aircraft with an integrated command and control battle management, or C2BM, surveillance, target detection, and tracking platform. The aircraft provides an accurate, real-time picture of the battlespace to the Joint Air Operations Center. AWACS provides situational awareness of friendly, neutral and hostile activity, command and control of an area of responsibility, battle management of theater forces, all-altitude and all-weather surveillance of the battle space, and early warning of enemy actions during joint, allied, and coalition operations.\n\nFeatures\u00a0\r\nThe E-3 Sentry is a modified Boeing 707/320 commercial airframe with a rotating radar dome. The dome is 30 feet (9.1 meters) in diameter, six feet (1.8 meters) thick, and is held 11 feet (3.33 meters) above the fuselage by two struts. It contains a radar subsystem that permits surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water. The radar has a range of more than 250 miles (375.5 kilometers). The radar combined with an identification friend or foe, or IFF, subsystem can look down to detect, identify and track enemy and friendly low-flying aircraft by eliminating ground clutter returns that confuse other radar systems.\n\r\nMajor subsystems in the E-3 are avionics, navigation, communications, sensors (radar and passive detection) and identification tools (IFF/SIF). The mission suite includes consoles that display computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens. Mission crew members perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions.\n\r\nThe radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 Sentry can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. \u00a0This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location and status of friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information can be sent to major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In time of crisis, this data can also be forwarded to the president and secretary of defense.\n\r\nIn support of air-to-ground operations, the Sentry can provide direct information needed for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift and close-air support for friendly ground forces. It can also provide information for commanders of air operations to gain and maintain control of the air battle.\n\r\nAs an air defense system, E-3s can detect, identify and track airborne enemy forces far from the boundaries of the United States or NATO countries. It can direct fighter-interceptor aircraft to these enemy targets. Experience has proven that the E-3 Sentry can respond quickly and effectively to a crisis and support worldwide military deployment operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry breaks away from a KC-135 Stratotanker after being refueled Feb. 28, 2019, while flying in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

It supports decentralized execution of the air tasking order/air combat order. The system provides the ability to find, fix, track and target airborne or maritime threats and to detect, locate and ID emitters. It has the ability to detect threats and control assets below and beyond the coverage of ground-based command and control or C2, and can exchange data with other C2 systems and shooters via datalinks.\n\r\nWith its mobility as an airborne warning and control system, the Sentry has a greater chance of surviving in warfare than a fixed, ground-based radar system. Among other things, the Sentry's flight path can quickly be changed according to mission and survival requirements. The E-3 can fly a mission profile approximately 8 hours without refueling. Its range and on-station time can be increased through in-flight refueling and the use of an on-board crew rest area.\n\nBackground\r\nEngineering, test and evaluation began on the first E-3 Sentry in October 1975. In March 1977 the 552nd Airborne Warning and Control Wing (now 552nd Air Control Wing, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.), received the first E-3s.\n\r\nThere are 31 aircraft in the U.S. inventory. Air Combat Command has 27 E-3s at Tinker. Pacific Air Forces has four E-3 Sentries at Kadena AB, Japan and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.\n\r\nNATO has 17 E-3A's and support equipment. The first E-3 was delivered to NATO in January 1982. The United Kingdom has seven E-3s, France has four, and Saudi Arabia has five. Japan has four AWACS built on the Boeing 767 airframe.\n\r\nAs proven in operations Desert Storm, Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Odyssey Dawn/Unified Protector the E-3 Sentry is the world's premier C2BM aircraft. AWACS aircraft and crews were instrumental to the successful completion of operations Northern and Southern Watch, and are still engaged in operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom. They provide radar surveillance and control in addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces. The E-3 has also deployed to support humanitarian relief operations in the U.S. following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, coordinating rescue efforts between military and civilian authorities.\n\r\nThe data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in the history of aerial warfare.\n\r\nIn March 1996, the Air Force activated the 513th Air Control Group, an AWACS Reserve Associate Program unit which performs duties on active-duty aircraft.\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1999, the first AWACS aircraft went through the Radar System Improvement Program. RSIP is a joint U.S./NATO development program that involved a major hardware and software intensive modification to the existing radar system. Installation of RSIP enhanced the operational capability of the E-3 radar electronic counter-measures and has improved the system's reliability, maintainability and availability.\n\r\nThe AWACS modernization program, Block 40/45, is currently underway. Bock 40/45 represents a revolutionary change for AWACS and worldwide Joint Command and Control, Battle Management, and Wide Area Surveillance. It is the most significant counter-air battle management improvement in Combat Air Forces tactical Command and Control history. The Block 40/45 Mission Computer and Display upgrade replaces current 1970 vintage mission computing and displays with a true open system and commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software, giving AWACS crews the modern computing tools needed to perform, and vastly improve mission capability.

The system disrupts enemy command and control communications and limits adversary coordination essential for enemy force management. The Compass Call system employs offensive counter-information and electronic attack (or EA) capabilities in support of U.S. and Coalition tactical air, surface, and special operations forces. The EC-130H, EA-6B or EA-18G, and F-16CJ, form the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) triad. Programmed upgrades have expanded its mission by procuring a secondary EA capability against early warning and acquisition radars. The EC-130H continuously tests new capabilities and tactics to respond to emerging threats and requests from combatant commanders.\n\nBackground\r\nAll Compass Call aircraft are assigned to Air Combat Command. The EC-130H is operated by the 55th Electronic Combat Group (ECG) consisting of two operational squadrons (41st and 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron (ECS)), a formal training unit (the 42nd ECS), the 755th Operations Support Squadron (OSS), and the 755th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS).

Four members are responsible for aircraft flight and navigation (aircraft commander, co-pilot, navigator and flight engineer), while nine members operate and employ the EA mission equipment permanently integrated in the cargo/mission compartment. The mission crew includes the mission crew commander (electronic warfare officer), weapon system officer (electronic warfare officer), mission crew supervisor (an experienced cryptologic linguist), four analysis operators (linguists), one acquisition operator and an airborne maintenance technician.\n\r\nThe EC-130H fleet is composed of a mix of Baseline 1 and 2 aircraft. The 55th ECG recently eclipsed 10,900 combat sorties and 66,500 flight hours as they provided U.S. and Coalition forces and Joint Commanders a flexible advantage across the spectrum of conflict. \u00a0COMPASS CALL\u2019s adaptability is directly attributed to its spiral upgrade acquisition strategy guided by the Big Safari Program office and Air Force Material Command\u2019s 661st Aeronautical Systems Squadron based in Waco, Texas. \u00a0Combined efforts between these agencies ensure the EC-130H can counter new, emergent communication technology.\u00a0\n\r\nThe Block 35 Baseline 1 EC-130H provides the Air Force with additional capabilities to jam communication, Early Warning/Acquisition radar and navigation systems through higher effective radiated power, extended frequency range and insertion of digital signal processing versus earlier EC-130Hs. Baseline 1 aircraft have the flexibility to keep pace with adversary use of emerging technology. \u00a0It is highly reconfigurable and permits incorporation of clip-ins with less crew impact. It promotes enhanced crew proficiency, maintenance and sustainment with a common fleet configuration, new operator interface, increased reliability and better fault detection.\n\r\nBaseline 2 has a number of upgrades to ease operator workload and improve effectiveness. Clip-in capabilities are now integrated into the operating system and, utilizing automated resource management, are able to be employed seamlessly with legacy capabilities. Improved external communications allow Compass Call crews to maintain situational awareness and connectivity in dynamic operational and tactical environments.\r\nDelivery of Baseline-2 provides the DoD with the equivalent of a \u201cfifth generation electronic attack capability.\u201d \u00a0A majority of the improvements found in the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline-2 are classified modifications to the mission system that enhance precision and increase attack capacity. Additionally, the system was re-designed to expand the \u201cplug-and-play\u201d quick reaction capability aspect, which has historically allowed the program to counter unique \u201cone-off\u201d high profile threats. \u00a0Aircraft communication capabilities are improved with expansion of satellite communications connectivity compatible with emerging DoD architectures, increased multi-asset coordination nets and upgraded data-link terminals. \u00a0Furthermore, modifications to the airframe in Baseline-2 provide improved aircraft performance and survivability. \u00a0\n\r\nThe Compass Call integrates into tactical air operations at any level.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe EC-130J Commando Solo, a specially-modified four-engine Hercules transport, conducts airborne Information Operations via digital and analog radio and television broadcasts. These missions are often flown at night to reduce probability of detection in politically sensitive or hostile territories.\n\r\nThe EC-130J are flown by the 193rd Special Operations Wing, a Pennsylvania Air National Guard unit, gained by Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nFeatures\r\nMany modifications were made to the basic C-130J to create the EC-130, including enhanced navigation systems, self-protection equipment and air refueling. The majority of the engineering investment went into the integration of the special mission equipment capable of up to 14 simultaneous broadcasts with the same or independent messages on each channel. Keeping pace with information-technology systems, message playback is accomplished using media stored digitally, e.g. hard drives, but the aircraft is still capable of accepting legacy media formats (CD/DVD etc.). In addition to pre-recorded messages, the EC-130J has the capability to conduct live broadcasts. In the last two deployments, the live broadcast option has gained considerable popularity. In its current configuration, the EC-130J is capable of a broad-range of tactics including; Information Operations (Influence) and Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, i.e. electronic attack.\n\nBackground\r\nThe genesis for this airborne IO platform can be traced back to 1968 and the 193rd Tactical Electronics Warfare Group receiving its first EC-121 Coronet Solo. The 193rd TEWG first tested this new capability while deployed to Korat, Thailand in 1970, where the wing conducted psychological operations broadcasts in support of U.S. forces in Vietnam.\nIn the late 1970\u2019s, the EC-121s were replaced by the venerable EC-130E and renamed Volant Solo. Soon after, the 193rd TEWG received its first tasking for the Volant Solo and participated in the rescue of American citizens during Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. The aircraft acted as an airborne radio station and kept the citizens of Grenada informed about U.S. military action. Several years later in 1989, Volant Solo was instrumental in the success of coordinated psychological operations in Operation Just Cause. During this mission, it broadcasted throughout the initial phases of the operation, helping to end the Noriega regime.\n\r\nIn 1990, now the 193rd Special Operations Group joined the newly formed Air Force Special Operations Command, and the wing's aircraft were redesignated Commando Solo, with no change in mission. In 1990-91, Commando Solo deployed to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Its missions included broadcasting the \"Voice of the Gulf\" and other highly successful programs intended to convince Iraqi soldiers to surrender.\n\r\nIn 1994, Commando Solo was used to broadcast radio and TV messages to the citizens and leaders of Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was featured in these broadcasts, which contributed to the orderly transition from military rule to democracy.\n\r\nContinuing its tradition, in 1997 the Commando Solo supported the U.N. Operation Joint Guard with radio and TV broadcasts over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of stabilization forces operations. In 1998, the unit and its aircraft participated in Operation Desert Thunder, a deployment to Southwest Asia to convince Iraq to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Commando Solo was again sent into action in 1999 in support of Operation Allied Force. The aircraft was tasked to broadcast radio and television into Kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing and assist in the expulsion of the Serbs from the region.\n\r\nAfter the tragic attacks on 9/11, the spirit and patriotism of 193rd Special Operations Wing Airmen was demonstrated when two EC-130E aircraft departed for Southwest Asia on Sept. 23, 2001. These aircraft broadcasted radio messages to the local Afghan population and Taliban soldiers at the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\r\nIn November 2002, two Commando Solo aircraft deployed to conduct Operational Preparation of the Environment broadcast missions over the Persian Gulf under the authorities of Operation Southern Watch. These daily missions continued up to and months after coalition forces invaded Iraq in March of 2003 which ushered in an additional phase of the Global War on Terrorism; Operation Iraqi Freedom. By April 2003, a total of four 193rd aircraft were deployed to three different operating locations.

    "description": "Mission \r\nThe F-15 Eagle is an all-weather, extremely maneuverable, tactical fighter designed to permit the Air Force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe Eagle's air superiority is achieved through a mixture of unprecedented maneuverability and acceleration, range, weapons and avionics. It can penetrate enemy defense and outperform and outfight any current enemy aircraft. The F-15 has electronic systems and weaponry to detect, acquire, track and attack enemy aircraft while operating in friendly or enemy-controlled airspace. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat.\n\r\nThe F-15's superior maneuverability and acceleration are achieved through high engine thrust-to-weight ratio and low wing-loading. Low wing-loading (the ratio of aircraft weight to its wing area) is a vital factor in maneuverability and, combined with the high thrust-to-weight ratio, enables the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed.\n\r\nA multi-mission avionics system sets the F-15 apart from other fighter aircraft. It includes a head-up display, advanced radar, inertial navigation system, flight instruments, ultrahigh frequency communications, tactical navigation system and instrument landing system. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic-warfare system, \"identification friend or foe\" system, electronic countermeasures set and a central digital computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn F-15 Eagle takes off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, July 28. The F-15 is assigned to the 19th Fighter Squadron. The unit is a part of the 3rd Wing at Elmendorf AFB and is one of three fighter squadrons there.

This display, visible in any light condition, provides information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit instruments.\n\r\nThe F-15's versatile pulse-Doppler radar system can look up at high-flying targets and down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. It can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15's electronic warfare system provides both threat warning and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.\n\r\nA variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to perform aerial combat safely and effectively, using the heads-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the heads-up display.\n\r\nThe Eagle can be armed with combinations of\u00a0different air-to-air weapons:\u00a0AIM-120 advanced medium range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder or AIM-120 missiles on two pylons under the wings\u00a0and an internal 20mm Gatling gun in the right wing root.\n\r\nThe F-15E is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and deep interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded to include four multi-purpose CRT displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler flight control system permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system.\n\r\nFor low-altitude, high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution APG-70 radar and low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night pods.\n\nBackground\r\nThe first F-15A flight was made in July 1972, and the first flight of the two-seat F-15B (formerly TF-15A) trainer was made in July 1973. The first Eagle (F-15B) was delivered in November 1974. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron was delivered.\n\r\nThe single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered the Air Force inventory beginning in 1979. These new models have Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000) improvements, including 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of additional internal fuel, provision for carrying exterior conformal fuel tanks and increased maximum takeoff weight of up to 68,000 pounds (30,600 kilograms).\n\r\nThe F-15 Multistage Improvement Program was initiated in February 1983, with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set\u00a0allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9\u00a0and AIM-120A missiles,\u00a0and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 included a Hughes APG-70 radar.\u00a0\n\r\nF-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability. F-15C fighters accounted for 34 of the 37 Air Force air-to-air victories. F-15E's were operated mainly at night, hunting SCUD missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.\n\r\nThey have since been deployed for air expeditionary force deployments and operations Southern Watch (no-fly zone in Southern Iraq), Provide Comfort in Turkey, Allied Force in Bosnia, Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary function: Tactical fighter\nContractor: McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nPower plant: Two Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-100, 220 or 229 turbofan engines with afterburners\nThrust: (C/D models) 23,450 pounds each engine\nWingspan: 42.8 feet (13 meters)\nLength: 63.8 feet (19.44 meters)\nHeight: 18.5 feet (5.6 meters)\u00a0\nWeight: 31,700 pounds\nMaximum takeoff weight: (C/D models) 68,000 pounds (30,844 kilograms)\nFuel\u00a0 Capacity: 36,200 pounds (three external plus conformal fuel tanks)\nPayload: depends on mission\nSpeed: 1,875 mph (Mach 2 class)\u00a0\nCeiling: 65,000 feet (19,812 meters)\nRange: 3,450 miles (3,000 nautical miles) ferry range with conformal fuel tanks and three external fuel tanks\nCrew: F-15A/C,\u00a0one;\u00a0F-15B/D/E,\u00a0two\nArmament: One internally mounted M-61A1\u00a020-mm, six-barrel cannon with 940 rounds of ammunition; four AIM-9 Sidewinder and four AIM-120 AMRAAMs or eight AIM-120 AMRAAMs, carried externally.\nUnit Cost: A/B models - $27.9 million (fiscal year 98 constant dollars);\u00a0C/D models - $29.9 million (fiscal year 98 constant dollars)\nInitial operating capability: September 1975\nInventory: Total force, 249\n(Current as of April 2019)"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe F-15E Strike Eagle is a dual-role fighter designed to perform air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. An array of avionics and electronics systems gives the F-15E the capability to fight at low altitude, day or night\u00a0and in all weather.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe aircraft uses two crew members, a pilot and a weapon systems officer. Previous models of the F-15 are assigned air-to-air roles; the \"E\" model is a dual-role fighter. It has the capability to fight its way to a target over long ranges, destroy enemy ground positions and fight its way out.\n\r\nThe aircraft's navigation system uses a laser gyro and a Global Positioning System to continuously monitor the aircraft's position and provide information to the central computer and other systems, including a digital moving map in both cockpits.\n\r\nThe APG-70 radar system allows aircrews to detect ground targets from long ranges. One feature of this system is that after a sweep of a target area, the crew freezes the air-to-ground map then goes back into air-to-air mode to clear for air threats. During the air-to-surface weapon delivery, the pilot is capable of detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air targets while the WSO designates the ground target.\n\r\nThe low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night, or LANTIRN, system allows the aircraft to fly at low altitudes, at night and in any weather conditions, to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided and unguided weapons. The LANTIRN system, consisting of two pods attached to the exterior of the air craft,\u00a0gives the F-15E unequaled accuracy in weapons delivery day or night and in poor weather.\n\r\nThe navigation pod contains terrain-following radar which allows the pilot to safely fly at a very low altitude following cues displayed on a heads-up display. This system also can be coupled to the aircraft's autopilot to provide \"hands off\" terrain-following capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle flies over Iraq on May 5, 2018.

Once tracking has been started, targeting information is automatically handed off to GPS or laser-guided bombs.\n\r\nOne of the most important additions to the F-15E is the rear cockpit with the weapons systems officer. On four screens, this officer can display information from the radar, electronic warfare or infrared sensors, monitor aircraft or weapons status and possible threats, select targets\u00a0and use an electronic \"moving map\" to navigate. Two hand controls are used to select new displays and to refine targeting information. Displays can be moved from one screen to another, chosen from a menu\u00a0of display options.\n\r\nIn addition to three similar screens in the front seat, the pilot has a transparent glass heads-up display at eye level that displays vital flight and tactical information. The pilot doesn't need to look down into the cockpit, for example, to check weapon status. At night, the screen is even more important because it displays a video picture nearly identical to a daylight view of the world generated by the forward-looking infrared sensor.\n\r\nThe F-15E is powered by two Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 or 229 engines that incorporate advanced digital technology for improved performance. For example, with a digital electronic engine control system, F-15E pilots can accelerate from idle power to maximum afterburner in less than four seconds, a 40 percent improvement over the previous engine control system. Faster engine acceleration means quicker takeoffs and crisper response while maneuvering. The F100-PW-220 engines can produce 50,000 pounds of thrust (25,000 each) and the F100-PW-229 engines 58,000 pounds of thrust (29,000 each).\n\r\nEach of the low-drag conformal fuel tanks that hug the F-15E's fuselage can carry 750 gallons of fuel. The tanks hold weapons on short pylons rather than conventional weapon racks, reducing drag and further extending the range of the Strike Eagle.\n\r\nFor air-to-ground missions, the F-15E can carry most weapons in the Air Force inventory. It also can be armed with\u00a0AIM-9M Sidewinders\u00a0or AIM-120 advanced medium range air-to-air missiles, or AMRAAM for the air-to-air role. The \"E\" model also has an internally mounted 20mm gun that can carry up to 500 rounds.\n\nBackground\r\nThe F-15's superior maneuverability and acceleration are achieved through its high engine thrust-to-weight ratio and low-wing loading. It was the first U.S. operational aircraft whose engines' thrust exceeded the plane's loaded weight, permitting it to accelerate even while in vertical climb. Low-wing loading (the ratio of aircraft weight to its wing area) is a vital factor in maneuverability and, combined with the high thrust-to-weight ratio, enables the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed.\n\r\nThe first flight of the F-15A was made in July 1972. In November 1974, the first Eagle was delivered to the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where training began in both F-15A and B aircraft. In January 1976, the first F-15 destined for a combat squadron was delivered to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at Langley AFB, Virginia.\n\r\nThe single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and were first delivered to Kadena Air Base, Japan.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It is highly maneuverable and has proven itself in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. It provides a relatively low-cost, high-performance weapon system for the United States and allied nations.\n\nFeatures\r\nIn an air combat role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low flying aircraft in radar ground clutter. In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions.\n\r\nIn designing the F-16, advanced aerospace science and proven reliable systems from other aircraft such as the F-15 and F-111 were selected. These were combined to simplify the airplane and reduce its size, purchase price, maintenance costs and weight. The light weight of the fuselage is achieved without reducing its strength. With a full load of internal fuel, the F-16 can withstand up to nine G's -- nine times the force of gravity -- which exceeds the capability of other current fighter aircraft.\n\r\nThe cockpit and its bubble canopy give the pilot unobstructed forward and upward vision, and greatly improved vision over the side and to the rear. The seat-back angle was expanded from the usual 13 degrees to 30 degrees, increasing pilot comfort and gravity force tolerance. The pilot has excellent flight control of the F-16 through its \"fly-by-wire\" system. Electrical wires relay commands, replacing the usual cables and linkage controls. For easy and accurate control of the aircraft during high G-force combat maneuvers, a side stick controller is used instead of the conventional center-mounted stick. Hand pressure on the side stick controller sends electrical signals to actuators of flight control surfaces such as ailerons and rudder.\n\r\nAvionics systems include a highly accurate enhanced global positioning and inertial navigation systems, or EGI, in which computers provide steering information to the pilot. The plane has UHF and VHF radios plus an instrument landing system. It also has a warning system and modular countermeasure pods to be used against airborne or surface electronic threats. The fuselage has space for additional avionics systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons assigned to the 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron fly over U.S. Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility during a mission in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, July 17, 2021.

The first operational F-16A was delivered in January 1979 to the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.\n\r\nThe F-16B, a two-seat model, has tandem cockpits that are about the same size as the one in the A model. Its bubble canopy extends to cover the second cockpit. To make room for the second cockpit, the forward fuselage fuel tank and avionics growth space were reduced. During training, the forward cockpit is used by a student pilot with an instructor pilot in the rear cockpit.\n\r\nAll F-16s delivered since November 1981 have built-in structural and wiring provisions and systems architecture that permit expansion of the multirole flexibility to perform precision strike, night attack and beyond-visual-range interception missions. This improvement program led to the F-16C and F-16D aircraft, which are the single- and two-place counterparts to the F-16A/B, and incorporate the latest cockpit control and display technology. All active units and many Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units have converted to the F-16C/D.\n\r\nThe F-16 was built under an unusual agreement creating a consortium between the United States and four NATO countries: Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. These countries jointly produced with the United States an initial 348 F-16s for their air forces. Final airframe assembly lines were located in Belgium and the Netherlands. The consortium's F-16s are assembled from components manufactured in all five countries. Belgium also provides final assembly of the F100 engine used in the European F-16s. Recently, Portugal joined the consortium. The long-term benefits of this program will be technology transfer among the nations producing the F-16, and a common-use aircraft for NATO nations. This program increases the supply and availability of repair parts in Europe and improves the F-16's combat readiness.\n\r\nU.S. Air Force F-16 multirole fighters were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm, where more sorties were flown than with any other aircraft. These fighters were used to attack airfields, military production facilities, Scud missiles sites and a variety of other targets.\n\r\nDuring Operation Allied Force, U.S. Air Force F-16 multirole fighters flew a variety of missions to include suppression of enemy air defense, offensive counter air, defensive counter air, close air support and forward air controller missions. Mission results were outstanding as these fighters destroyed radar sites, vehicles, tanks, MiGs and buildings.\n\r\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, the F-16 has been a major component of the combat forces committed to the war on terrorism flying thousands of sorties in support of operations Noble Eagle (Homeland Defense), Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom\n\nGeneral characteristics\nPrimary function: multirole fighter\nContractor: Lockheed Martin Corp.\nPower plant: F-16C/D: one Pratt and Whitney F100-PW-200/220/229 or General Electric F110-GE-100/129\nThrust: F-16C/D, 27,000 pounds\nWingspan: 32 feet, 8 inches (9.8 meters)\nLength: 49 feet, 5 inches (14.8 meters)\nHeight: 16 feet (4.8 meters)\nWeight: 19,700 pounds without fuel (8,936 kilograms) \u00a0\nMaximum takeoff weight: 37,500 pounds (16,875 kilograms) \u00a0\nFuel capacity: 7,000 pounds internal (3,175 kilograms); typical capacity, 12,000 pounds with two external tanks (5443 kilograms)\nPayload: two 2,000-pound bombs, two AIM-9, two AIM-120 and two 2400-pound external fuel tanks\nSpeed: 1,500 mph (Mach 2 at altitude)\nRange: more than 2,002 miles ferry range (1,740 nautical miles)\nCeiling: above 50,000 feet (15 kilometers)\nArmament: one M-61A1 20mm multibarrel cannon with 500 rounds; external stations can carry up to six air-to-air missiles, conventional air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions and electronic countermeasure pods\nCrew: F-16C, one; F-16D, one or two\nUnit cost: F-16A/B , $14.6 million (fiscal 98 constant dollars); F-16C/D,$18.8 million (fiscal 98 constant dollars) \u00a0\nInitial operating capability: F-16A, January 1979; F-16C/D Block 25-32, 1981; \u00a0F-16C/D Block 40-42, 1989; and F-16C/D Block 50-52, 1994\nInventory: total force, F-16C/D, 1017\n\r\n(Current as of September 2021)\n\nPoint of Contact\r\nAir Combat Command, Public Affairs Office; 115 Thompson St., Suite 210; Langley AFB, VA 23665-1987; DSN 574-5007 or 757-764-5007; e-mail: accpa.operations@us.af.mil"

The Raptor performs both\u00a0air-to-air and air-to-ground missions allowing full realization of\u00a0operational concepts vital to the 21st century Air Force.\n\r\nThe F-22, a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force, is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances and defeat threats attempting to deny access to our nation's Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft.\n\nFeatures\r\nA combination of sensor capability, integrated avionics, situational awareness, and weapons provides first-kill opportunity against threats. The F-22 possesses a sophisticated sensor suite allowing the pilot to track, identify, shoot and kill air-to-air threats before being detected. Significant advances in cockpit design and sensor fusion improve the pilot's situational awareness. In the air-to-air configuration the Raptor carries six AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn F-22 Raptor from the F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team performs during the Battle Creek Field of Flight Air Show and Balloon Festival in Battle Creek, Mich., July 5, 2021.

In the air-to-ground configuration the aircraft can carry two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions internally and will use on-board avionics for navigation and weapons delivery support. In the future air-to-ground capability will be enhanced with the addition of an upgraded radar and up to eight small diameter bombs. The Raptor will also carry two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s in the air-to-ground configuration.\n\r\nAdvances in low-observable technologies provide significantly improved survivability and lethality against air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. The F-22 brings stealth into the day, enabling it not only to protect itself but other assets.\n\r\nThe F-22 engines produce more thrust than any current fighter engine. The combination of sleek aerodynamic design and increased thrust allows the F-22 to cruise at supersonic airspeeds (greater than 1.5 Mach) without using afterburner -- a characteristic known as supercruise. Supercruise greatly expands the F-22 's operating envelope in both speed and range over current fighters, which must use fuel-consuming afterburner to operate at supersonic speeds.\n\r\nThe sophisticated F-22 aerodesign, advanced flight controls, thrust vectoring, and high thrust-to-weight ratio provide the capability to outmaneuver all current and projected aircraft. The F-22 design has been extensively tested and refined aerodynamically during the development process.\n\r\nThe F-22's characteristics provide a synergistic effect ensuring F-22A lethality against all advanced air threats. The combination of stealth, integrated avionics and supercruise drastically shrinks surface-to-air missile engagement envelopes and minimizes enemy capabilities to track and engage the F-22. The combination of reduced observability and supercruise accentuates the advantage of surprise in a tactical environment.\n\r\nThe F-22 will have better reliability and maintainability than any fighter aircraft in history. \u00a0Increased F-22 reliability and maintainability pays off in less manpower required to fix the aircraft and the ability to operate more efficiently.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Advanced Tactical Fighter entered the Demonstration and Validation phase in 1986. The prototype aircraft (YF-22 and YF-23) both completed their first flights in late 1990. Ultimately the YF-22 was selected as best of the two and the engineering and manufacturing development effort began in 1991 with development contracts to Lockheed/Boeing (airframe) and Pratt & Whitney (engines). EMD included extensive subsystem and system testing as well as flight testing with nine aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The first EMD flight was in 1997 and at the completion of its flight test life this aircraft was used for live-fire testing.\n\r\nThe program received approval to enter low rate initial production in 2001. Initial operational and test evaluation by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center was successfully completed in 2004. Based on maturity of design and other factors the program received approval for full rate production in 2005. Air Education and Training Command, Air Combat Command and Pacific Air Forces are the primary Air Force organizations flying the F-22. \u00a0The aircraft designation was the F/A-22 for a short time before being renamed F-22A in December 2005.\n\nGeneral characteristics\nPrimary function: air dominance, multi-role fighter\nContractor: Lockheed-Martin, Boeing\nPower plant: two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines with afterburners and two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles.\nThrust: 35,000-pound class (each engine)\nWingspan: 44 feet, 6 inches (13.6 meters)\nLength: 62 feet, 1 inch (18.9 meters)\nHeight: 16 feet, 8 inches (5.1 meters)\nWeight: 43,340 pounds (19,700 kilograms) \u00a0\nMaximum takeoff weight: 83,500 pounds (38,000 kilograms) \u00a0\nFuel capacity: internal: 18,000 pounds (8,200 kilograms); with 2 external wing fuel tanks: 26,000 pounds (11,900 kilograms)\nPayload: same as armament air-to-air or air-to-ground loadouts; with or without two external wing fuel tanks.\nSpeed: \u00a0mach two class with supercruise capability\nRange: more than 1,850 miles ferry range with two external wing fuel tanks (1,600 nautical miles)\nCeiling: above 50,000 feet (15 kilometers)\nArmament: one M61A2 20-millimeter cannon with 480 rounds, internal side weapon bays carriage of two AIM-9 infrared (heat seeking) air-to-air missiles and internal main weapon bays carriage of six AIM-120 radar-guided air-to-air missiles (air-to-air loadout) or two 1,000-pound GBU-32 JDAMs and two AIM-120 radar-guided air-to-air missiles (air-to-ground loadout)\nCrew: one\nUnit cost: $143 million\nInitial operating capability: \u00a0December 2005\nInventory: total force, 183\n\r\n\u00a0(Current as of August 2022)\n\nPoint of Contact\r\nAir Combat Command, Public Affairs Office; 115 Thompson St., Suite 210; Langley AFB, VA 23665-1987; DSN 574-5007 or 757-764-5007; e-mail: accpa.operations@us.af.mil"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe F-35A is the U.S. Air Force\u2019s latest fifth-generation fighter. It will replace the U.S. Air Force\u2019s aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolt II\u2019s, which have been the primary fighter aircraft for more than 20 years, and bring with it an enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate. With its aerodynamic performance and advanced integrated avionics, the F-35A will provide next-generation stealth, enhanced situational awareness, and reduced vulnerability for the United States and allied nations.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A gives the U.S. Air Force and its allies the power to dominate the skies \u2013 anytime, anywhere. The F-35A is an agile, versatile, high-performance, 9g capable multirole fighter that combines stealth, sensor fusion\u00a0and unprecedented situational awareness.\n\r\nThe F-35A\u2019s advanced sensor package is designed to gather, fuse and distribute more information than any fighter in history, giving operators a decisive advantage over all adversaries. Its processing power, open architecture, sophisticated sensors, information fusion and flexible communication links make the F-35 an indispensable tool in future homeland defense, Joint and Coalition irregular warfare and major combat operations.\n\r\nBecause logistics support accounts for two-thirds of an aircraft's life cycle cost, the F-35 is designed to achieve unprecedented levels of reliability and maintainability, combined with a highly responsive support and training system linked with the latest in information technology. The Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) integrates current performance, operational parameters, current configuration, scheduled upgrades and maintenance, component history, predictive diagnostics (prognostics) and health management, operations scheduling, training, mission planning and service support for the F-35. Essentially, ALIS performs behind-the-scenes monitoring, maintenance and prognostics to support the aircraft and ensure continued health and enhance operational planning and execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaj.

This system provides pilots with situational awareness in a sphere around the aircraft for enhanced missile warning, aircraft warning, and day/night pilot vision. Additionally, the aircraft is equipped with the Electro-Optical Targeting System.\u00a0The internally mounted EOTS provides extended range detection and precision targeting against ground targets, plus long range detection of air-to-air threats.\n\r\nThe F-35\u2019s helmet mounted display system is the most advanced system of its kind. All the intelligence and targeting information an F-35 pilot needs to complete the mission is displayed on the helmet\u2019s visor.\n\r\nThe F-35 contains state-of-the-art tactical data links that provide the secure sharing of data among its flight members as well as other airborne, surface and ground-based platforms required to perform assigned missions. The commitment of JSF partner nations to common communications capabilities and web-enabled logistics support will enable a new level of Coalition interoperability. These capabilities allow the F-35 to lead the defense community in the migration to the net-centric war fighting force of the future.\n\r\nThe F-35\u2019s engine produces 43,000 lbs of thrust and consists of a three-stage fan, a six-stage compressor, an annular combustor, a single-stage high-pressure turbine, and a two-stage low-pressure turbine.\n\r\nThe F-35 is designed to provide the pilot with unsurpassed situational awareness, positive target identification and precision strike in all weather conditions. Mission systems integration and outstanding over-the-nose visibility features are designed to dramatically enhance pilot performance.\n\r\nWith nine countries involved in its development (United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Australia), the F-35 represents a new model of international cooperation, ensuring U.S. and Coalition partner security well into the 21st Century. The F-35 also brings together strategic international partnerships, providing affordability by reducing redundant research and development and providing access to technology around the world. Along these lines, the F-35 will employ a variety of US and allied weapons.\nBackground\r\nThe F-35 is designed to replace aging fighter inventories including U.S. Air Force F-16s and A-10s, U.S. Navy F/A-18s, U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers and F/A-18s, and U.K. Harrier GR.7s and Sea Harriers. With stealth and a host of next-generation technologies, the F-35 will be far and away the world\u2019s most advanced multi-role fighter. There exists an aging fleet of tactical aircraft worldwide. The F-35 is intended to solve that problem.\n\r\nOn October 26, 2001, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Edward C. \"Pete\" Aldridge Jr. announced the decision to proceed with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. This approval advanced the program to the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase. The Secretary of the Air Force James G. Roche announced the selection of Lockheed Martin teamed with Northrop Grumman and BAE to develop and then produce the JSF aircraft.\n\r\nDuring this SDD phase, the program will focus on developing a family of strike aircraft that significantly reduces life-cycle cost while meeting operational requirements. The requirements represent a balanced approach to affordability, lethality, survivability and supportability. The program will use a phased block approach that addresses aircraft and weapons integration and provides a validated and verified air system for Initial Operational Capability requirements.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Multirole fighter\nPrime Contractor: Lockheed Martin\nPower Plant: One Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 turbofan engine\nThrust: 43,000 pounds\nWingspan: 35 feet (10.7 meters)\nLength: 51 feet (15.7 meters)\nHeight: 14 feet (4.38 meters)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 70,000 pound class\nFuel Capacity: Internal: 18,498 pounds\nPayload: 18,000 pounds (8,160 kilograms)\nSpeed: Mach 1.6 (~1,200 mph)\nRange: More than 1,350 miles with internal fuel (1,200+ nautical miles), unlimited with aerial refueling\nCeiling: Above 50,000 feet (15 kilometers)\nArmament: Internal and external capability.

    "title": "GBU-15 Guided Bomb Unit",
    "description": "Mission\r\nThe Guided Bomb Unit or GBU-15 is an unpowered, glide weapon used to destroy high value enemy targets. It was designed for use with F-15E, F-111F and F-4 aircraft, but the U.S. Air Force is currently only deploying it from the F-15E Strike Eagle.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe weapon consists of modular components that are attached to either a MK-84 general purpose or BLU-109 penetrating warhead. Each weapon has five components-- a forward guidance section, warhead adapter section, control module, airfoil components and a weapon data link.\n\r\nThe guidance section is attached to the nose of the weapon and contains either a television guidance system for daytime or an imaging infrared system for night or limited, adverse weather operations. A data link in the tail section sends guidance updates to the control aircraft that enables the weapon systems operator to guide the bomb by remote control to its target.\n\r\nAn external electrical conduit extends the length of the warhead and attaches the guidance adapter and control unit. The conduit carries electrical signals between the guidance and control sections. The umbilical receptacle passes guidance and control data between cockpit control systems of the launching aircraft and the weapon prior to launch.\n\r\nThe rear control section consists of four wings that are in an \"X\"-like arrangement with trailing edge flap control surfaces for flight maneuvering. The control module contains the autopilot, which collects steering data from the guidance section and converts the information into signals that move the wing control surfaces to change the weapon's flight path.\n\r\nThe GBU-15 may be used in either a direct or an indirect attack mode. In a direct attack mode, the pilot selects a target before launch, locks the weapon guidance system onto it and launches the weapon. The weapon automatically guides itself to the target, enabling the pilot to leave the area. In an indirect attack mode, the weapon is guided by remote control after launch. The pilot releases the weapon and, via remote control, searches for the target. Once the target is acquired, the weapon can be locked to the target or manually guided via the data-link system.\n\r\nThis highly maneuverable weapon has an optimal, low-to-medium altitude delivery capability with pinpoint accuracy. It also has a standoff capability. In Desert Storm, F-111F pilots used GBU-15 glide bombs to seal flaming oil pipeline manifolds sabotaged by Saddam Hussein's troops.\n\r\nDuring 1999 to 2000, a large number of Legacy GBU-15 weapons received a significant upgrade in the ability to attack in adverse weather conditions by adding a Global Positioning System/inertial navigation system guidance capability. This important upgrade further enhances the warfighter's ability to attack targets, day or night. The enhanced GBU-15 weapon system was successfully employed in combat in 2001, directly supporting Operation Enduring Freedom combat operations.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Air Force Development Test Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., began developing the GBU-15 in 1974. It was a product improvement of the early guided bombs used during the Southeast Asia conflict. Flight testing of the weapon began in 1975. The GBU-15 with television guidance completed full-scale operational test and evaluation in November 1983. In February 1985, initial operational test and evaluation was completed on the imaging infrared guidance seeker.\n\r\nIn December 1987, the program management responsibility for the GBU-15 weapon system transferred from the Air Force Systems Command to the Air Force Logistics Command. The commands merged to become the Air Force Materiel Command in 1992.\n\r\nDuring the integrated weapons system management process, AGM-130 and GBU-15 were determined to be a family of weapons because of the commonality of the two systems. The Precision Strike Program Office at Eglin AFB became the single manager for the GBU-15, with the Air Logistics Center at Hill AFB, Utah, providing sustainment support.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Air-to-surface guided glide bomb\nContractor: Boeing North American for Legacy version; Raytheon Systems for Enhanced version\nLength: 12 feet, 10.5 inches (3.91 meters)\nLaunch Weight: 2,500 pounds (1,125 kilograms)\nDiameter: 18 inches (45.7 centimeters)\nWingspan: 4 feet, 11 inches (1.49 meters)\nRange: 5-15 nautical miles\nCeiling: 30,000-plus feet (9,091 meters)\nSpeed: Classified\nGuidance System: Television or imaging infrared seeker via man-in-the-loop link, autonomous GPS/INS\nWarheads: MK-84 general purpose or BLU-109 penetrating bombs\nDate Deployed: Legacy, 1983; Enhanced, 2001\nUnit cost: TV: $242,500; IIR: $245,000\nInventory: Classified"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe GBU-39B Small Diameter Bomb, or SDB, is an extended range all-weather, day or night 250-pound class, guided munition. The SDB relies on the Global Positioning System to provide navigation to the target. Additionally, its small size allows increased aircraft loadout to achieve multiple kills per sortie and inherently reduces the probability of collateral damage.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe SDB system employs a smart carriage capable of carrying four 250-lb class guided air-to-surface munitions. It is capable of destroying high-priority fixed and stationary targets from Air Force fighters and bombers in internal bays or on external hard-points. SDB increases aircraft loadout, decreases the logistical footprint, decreases collateral damage, and improves aircraft sortie generation times.\n\r\nThe SDB provides a transformational capability to the warfighter increasing smart weapon carriage by placing up to four smart weapons per 1760 store location.\n\r\nThe weapon system is capable of standoff ranges in excess of 40 nautical miles. The system can be targeted and released against single or multiple targets. SDB target coordinates are loaded into the weapon before release either on the ground or in the air by the aircrew.

It is an extended-range version of the C-130J Hercules transport. Its mission is to rapidly deploy to execute combatant commander directed recovery operations to austere airfields and denied territory for expeditionary, all weather personnel recovery operations to include airdrop, airland, helicopter air-to-air refueling, and forward area ground refueling missions. When tasked, the aircraft also conducts humanitarian assistance operations, disaster response, security cooperation/aviation advisory, emergency aeromedical evacuation, and noncombatant evacuation operations.\n\nFeatures \r\nModifications to the HC-130J have improved navigation, threat detection and countermeasures systems. The aircraft fleet has a fully-integrated inertial navigation and global positioning systems, and night vision goggle, or NVG, compatible interior and exterior lighting. It also has forward-looking infrared, radar and missile warning receivers, chaff and flare dispensers, satellite and data-burst communications, and the ability to receive fuel inflight via a Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI).\n\r\nThe HC-130J can fly in the day; however, crews normally fly night at low to medium altitude levels in contested or sensitive environments, both over land or overwater.

During Operation Desert Storm they provided combat search and rescue coverage for coalition forces in western Iraq, coastal Kuwait, the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia. They also provided emergency evacuation coverage for U.S. Navy SEAL teams penetrating the Kuwaiti coast before the invasion.\n\r\nDuring Operation Allied Force, Pave Hawks provided continuous combat search and rescue coverage for NATO air forces, and successfully recovered two Air Force pilots who were isolated behind enemy lines.\n\r\nIn the aircraft's humanitarian relief missions, three Pave Hawks deployed in March 2000 to Mozambique, Africa, to support international flood relief operations. The HH-60s flew 240 missions in 17 days and delivered more than 160 tons of humanitarian relief supplies.\n\r\nAfter Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, more than 20 active-duty, Reserve, and National Guard Pave Hawks were deployed to Jackson, Miss., in support of recovery operations in New Orleans and surrounding areas. Pave Hawk crews flew 24-hour operations for nearly a month, saving more than 4,300 Americans from the post-hurricane devastation.\n\r\nWithin 24 hours of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, HH-60Gs deployed to support Operation Tomodachi providing search and rescue capability to the disaster relieve\n\r\nToday, Pave Hawks continue to deploy in support of operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.

    "title": "High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting System",
    "description": "Mission The High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile Targeting System, or HTS, is a system for use on the Air Force's F-16CJ Block 50/52 Fighting Falcon. This targeting system is the cornerstone of the suppression of enemy air defense mission, providing substantial situational awareness to pilots on the types and locations of surface-to-air defense radars, as well as passing ranging solutions to the HARM missile when launched.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe HTS system consists of the pod, the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, or HARM,\u00a0 the aircraft launcher interface computer, and HTS-unique F-16 software. The pod is mounted externally on the right engine inlet hardpoint for the release 6, or R6, pod and the left engine inlet hardpoint for the release 7, or R7, pod.\n\r\nThe current configurations are R6 and R7 pods. R7, a hardware and software retrofit to the R6, provides precision targeting for various precision guided munitions, or PGMs, to support the destruction of enemy air defenses mission. The retrofit is on-going and all R6 to R7 upgrades should be completed by the end of 2008.\n\r\nThe HTS system provides an all-weather detection and identification of enemy air defense radars. The aircraft displays the type, range and bearing of threat radars to the pilot. During flight, the pilot can adjust the search volume and radio frequency scan to optimize detection and ranging performance.\n\r\nPilots designate targets on the HARM Attack Display for launch. Upon firing, the HTS derived target\u00a0information\u00a0is sent to the HARM missile. The precision targeting capability of the R7 pod allows employment of various PGMs using an aircraft datalink system to quickly identify and target threats from any PGM-carrying platform on the network. Pilots can also datalink precision targeting coordinates to other F-16s or to the RC-135 Rivet Joint.\u00a0\n\nBackground\r\nHTS was developed to fill the void left from the deactivation of the F-4G Wild Weasel. The original contract was awarded to Texas Instruments Corp. (now Raytheon Systems Company) in 1991. The initial operational capability of the first squadron was declared in 1994. The Air Force has continued to purchase additional quantities of HTS pods and now plans to purchase pods to support the entire F-16 Block 50/52 fleet.\u00a0\n\r\nThe original HTS pod was upgraded in 1996 with a software Release 5, which vastly increased ranging speed and improved threat identification. R6 increased frequency coverage, search speed, number of targets tracked, and identification capabilities, and was fielded in May 2000. The latest software and hardware revision, known as R7, increases frequency coverage, search speed, number of targets tracked and identification capabilities, adds precision targeting and was fielded in September 2006.\n\r\nThe R6 upgrade has received a significant level of interest since Operation Desert Storm. Two F-16CJ aircraft with R6 pods were used along with a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft in a joint demonstration in November 2000. The HTS continues to be evaluated as a system to assist in time critical targeting, or TCT, which has Department of Defense interest. The joint demonstration proved that TCT could be accomplished today if employed with precision coordinates provided in a timely manner to meet TCT mission requirements.\n\r\nThe R7 pod provides the Air Force more accurate and timely targeting, and offers improved capabilities for joint TCT missions. R7 employs a new digital receiver and GPS hardware capability, along with using Link-16 connectivity between aircraft, which will allow precision targeting solutions to potentially any PGM requiring GPS accuracy; such as, joint direct attack munitions, joint air-to-surface standoff missiles. The retrofit to R7 pods is expected to be complete by 2008.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary function: Detection, identification, and ranging of air defense radars\nContractor: Raytheon Systems Company, Inc.\nLength: 56 inches (1.42 meters)\nDiameter: 8 inches (.20 meters)\nWeight: R6,\u00a082.5 pounds (37.7 kilograms); R7,\u00a0100 pounds (45 kilograms)\nAircraft: F-16CJ (Block 50/52)\nSensors: Interferometer based\nUnit cost: Not available\nInitial operating\u00a0capability: March 1994\nInventory: Not available"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe Joint Direct Attack Munition is a guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, adverse weather \"smart\" munitions. With the addition of a new tail section that contains an inertial navigational system and a global positioning system guidance control unit, JDAM improves the accuracy of unguided, general purpose bombs in any weather condition. JDAM is a joint U.S. Air Force and Department of Navy program.\n\nFeatures\r\nJDAM is a guided air-to-surface weapon that uses either the 2,000-pound BLU-109/MK 84, the 1,000-pound BLU-110/MK 83 or the 500-pound BLU-111/MK 82 warhead as the payload. JDAM enables employment of accurate air-to-surface weapons against high priority fixed and relocatable targets from fighter and bomber aircraft. Guidance is facilitated through a tail control system and a GPS-aided INS. The navigation system is initialized by transfer alignment from the aircraft that provides position and velocity vectors from the aircraft systems.\n\r\nOnce released from the aircraft, the JDAM autonomously navigates to the designated target coordinates. Target coordinates can be loaded into the aircraft before takeoff, manually altered by the aircrew before weapon release, or automatically entered through target designation with onboard aircraft sensors. In its most accurate mode, the JDAM system will provide a weapon circular error probable of 5 meters or less during free flight when GPS data is available. If GPS data is denied, the JDAM will achieve a 30-meter CEP or less for free flight times up to 100 seconds with a GPS quality handoff from the aircraft.\n\r\nJDAM can be launched from very low to very high altitudes in a dive, toss or loft and in straight and level flight with an on-axis or off-axis delivery. JDAM enables multiple weapons to be directed against single or multiple targets on a single pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Force Tech. Sgt.

Follow-on integration efforts are currently underway or planned to evaluate compatibility with the A-10, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\nBackground\r\nDesert Storm highlighted a shortfall in air-to-surface weapon capability. Adverse weather conditions limited employment of precision guided munitions. Unguided weapon accuracy was also degraded when delivered from medium and high altitudes. Research and development of an \"adverse weather precision guided munition\" began in 1992. The first JDAMs were delivered in 1997 with initial operational testing conducted in 1998 and 1999. More than 450 JDAMs were dropped during this testing, recording an unprecedented 95 percent system reliability while achieving a 9.6-meter accuracy rate. JDAM performance has been demonstrated in operationally representative tests including drops through clouds, rain and snow. These tests included a B-2 releasing 80 JDAMs on a single pass against multiple targets.\n\r\nJDAM and the B-2 made their combat debuts during Operation Allied Force. The B-2s, flying 30-hour, nonstop, roundtrip flights from Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., delivered more than 600 JDAMs during Allied Force. This combination of stealth and accuracy has revolutionized air warfare. Growth of the JDAM family of weapons expanded to the MK-82 500-pound version, which began development in late 1999. Enhancements such as improved GPS accuracy, a precision seeker for terminal guidance extended range, in-flight target updating and additional warheads are being demonstrated and tested for future consideration.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Guided air-to-surface weapon\nContractor: Boeing Company\nLength: (JDAM and warhead) GBU-31 (v) 1/B: 152.7 inches (387.9 centimeters); GBU-31 (v) 3/B: 148.6 inches (377.4 centimeters); GBU-32 (v) 1/B: 119.5 inches (303.5 centimeters); GBU-38: 92.6 inches (235.2 centimeters)\nLaunch Weight: (JDAM and warhead) GBU-31 (v) 1/B: 2,036 pounds (925.4 kilograms); GBU-31 (v) 3/B: 2,115 pounds (961.4 kilograms); GBU-32 (v) 1/B: 1,013 pounds (460.5 kilograms); GBU-38: 558 pounds (253.6 kilograms)\nWingspan: GBU-31: 25 inches (63.5 centimeters); GBU-32: 19.6 inches (49.8 centimeters); GBU-38: 14 inches (35.6 centimeters)\nRange: Up to 15 miles\nCeiling: 45,000-plus feet (13,677 meters)\nGuidance System: GPS/INS\nUnit cost: Approximately $22,000 per tailkit (fiscal 2007 dollars)\nDate Deployed: 1999\nInventory: The tailkit is in full-rate production.

    "description": "Mission The KC-10 Extender is an Air Mobility Command advanced tanker and cargo aircraft designed to provide increased global mobility for U.S. armed forces. Although the KC-l0's primary mission is aerial refueling, it can combine the tasks of a tanker and cargo aircraft by refueling fighters and simultaneously carry the fighter support personnel and equipment on overseas deployments. The KC-10 is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe KC-10 can transport up to 75 people and nearly 170,000 pounds (76,560 kilograms) of cargo a distance of about 4,400 miles (7,040 kilometers) unrefueled.\n\r\nIn addition to the three main DC-10 wing fuel tanks, the KC-10 has three large fuel tanks under the cargo floor, one under the forward lower cargo compartment, one in the center wing area and one under the rear compartment. Combined, the capacity of the six tanks carries more than 356,000 pounds (160,200 kilograms) of fuel - almost twice as much as the KC-135 Stratotanker.\n\r\nUsing either an advanced aerial refueling boom, or a hose and drogue centerline refueling system, the KC-10 can refuel a wide variety of U.S. and allied military aircraft within the same mission. The aircraft is equipped with lighting for night operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA U.S Air Force KC-10 Extender with the 76th Air Refueling Squadron, 514th Air Mobility Wing, is refueled by a KC-10 crewed by Reserve Citizen Airmen with the 78th Air Refueling Squadron, 514th Air Mobility Wing, over the Atlantic Ocean, Feb. 14, 2018.

Sitting in the rear of the aircraft, the operator can see the receiver aircraft through a wide window. During boom refueling operations, fuel is transferred to the receiver at a maximum rate of 1,100 gallons (4,180 liters) per minute; the hose and drogue refueling maximum rate is 470 gallons (1,786 liters) per minute. The automatic load alleviation and independent disconnect systems greatly enhance safety and facilitate air refueling. The KC-10 can be air-refueled by a KC-135 or another KC-10A to increase its delivery range.\n\r\nThe large cargo-loading door can accept most air forces' fighter unit support equipment. Powered rollers and winches inside the cargo compartment permit moving heavy loads. The cargo compartment can accommodate loads ranging from 27 pallets to a mix of 17 pallets and 75 passengers.\n\nBackground\r\nA modified Boeing Company DC-10, the KC-10A entered service in 1981. Although it retains 88 percent of systems commonality with the DC-10, it has additional systems and equipment necessary for its Air Force mission. These additions include military avionics; aerial refueling boom and aerial refueling hose and drogue; seated aerial refueling operator station; and aerial refueling receptacle and satellite communications.\n\r\nTwenty KC-10s were modified to add wing-mounted pods further enhancing their aerial refueling capabilities. Ongoing modifications include the addition of communications, navigation and surveillance equipment to meet future civil air traffic control needs, and the incorporation of service bulletins to maintain Federal Aviation Administration certification.\n\r\nThe KC-10A is operated by the 305th Air Mobility Wing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J.; and the 60th Air Mobility Wing, Travis Air Force Base, Calif. Air Force Reserve Associate units are assigned to the 349th Air Mobility Wing at Travis, and the 514th Air Mobility Wing at JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.\n\r\nDuring operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991, the KC-10 fleet provided in-flight refueling to aircraft from the U.S. armed forces as well as those of other coalition forces. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, in-flight refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive Persian Gulf buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.\n\r\nIn March 1999, a NATO air campaign, Operation Allied Force, was launched against the government of Yugoslavia. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily tanker dependent. By early May 1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in Kosovo.\n\r\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, KC-10s have played a prominent role. The KC-10 has flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies as a part of Operation Noble Eagle. During operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, KC-10s flew more than 1,390 missions delivering critical air refueling support to numerous joint and coalition receiver aircraft.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Aerial tanker and transport\nContractor: The Boeing Company\nPower Plant: Three General Electric CF6-50C2 turbofans\nThrust: 52,500 pounds, each engine\nLength: 181 feet, 7 inches (54.4 meters)\nHeight: 58 feet, 1 inch (17.4 meters)\nWingspan: 165 feet, 4.5 inches (50 meters)\nSpeed: 619 mph (Mach 0.825)\nCeiling: 42,000 feet (12,727 meters)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 590,000 pounds (265,500 kilograms)\nRange: 4,400 miles (3,800 nautical miles) with cargo; 11,500 miles (10,000 nautical miles) without cargo\nMaximum Cargo Payload: 170,000 pounds (76,560 kilograms)\nPallet Positions: 27\r\nMaximum Fuel Load: 356,000 pounds (160,200 kilograms)\nCrew: Four (pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and boom operator) Certain missions may require additional crew members.

One crewmember, known as the boom operator, is stationed in the rear of the plane and controls the boom during in-flight air refueling.\nA special shuttlecock-shaped drogue attached to and trailing behind the flying boom may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. Some aircraft have been configured with the multipoint refueling system, which consists of special pods mounted on the wingtips. These KC-135s are capable of refueling two receiver aircraft at the same time.\nBackground\nAir Mobility Command manages an inventory of 396 Stratotankers, of which the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard fly 243 aircraft in support of AMC's mission.\nThe Boeing Company's model 367-80 was the basic design for the commercial 707 passenger plane as well as the KC-135A Stratotanker. In 1954, the Air Force purchased the first 29 of its future 732-plane fleet. The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to Castle Air Force Base, Calif., in June 1957. The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965.\nOf the original KC-135As, more than 417 were modified with new CFM-56 engines produced by CFM-International. The re-engined tanker, designated either the KC-135R or KC-135T, can offload 50 percent more fuel, is 25 percent more fuel efficient, costs 25 percent less to operate and is 96 percent quieter than the KC-135A.\nUnder another modification program, a re-engined tanker with the TF-33-PW-102 engine was designated the KC-135E. In 2009, the last KC-135E retired from the inventory.\nThrough the years, the KC-135 has been altered to do other jobs ranging from flying command post missions to reconnaissance. RC-135s are used for special reconnaissance and Air Force Materiel Command's NKC-135As are flown in test programs. Air Combat Command operates the OC-135 as an observation platform in compliance with the Open Skies Treaty.\nThe KC-135R and KC-135T aircraft continue to undergo life-cycle upgrades to expand their capabilities and improve reliability.

    "description": "Mission\r\nLow Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night, or LANTIRN, is a system for use on the Air Force's premier fighter aircraft \u2014 the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. LANTIRN significantly increases the combat effectiveness of these aircraft, allowing them to fly at low altitudes, at night and under-the-weather to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided and unguided weapons.\n\nFeatures\r\nLANTIRN consists of a navigation pod and a targeting pod integrated and mounted externally beneath the aircraft.\n\r\nThe navigation pod provides high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night and in adverse weather. The navigation pod also contains a terrain-following radar and a fixed infrared sensor, which provides a visual cue and input to the aircraft's flight control system, enabling it to maintain a pre-selected altitude above the terrain and avoid obstacles. This sensor displays an infrared image of the terrain in front of the aircraft, to the pilot, on a head-up display. The navigation pod enables the pilot to fly along the general contour of the terrain at high speed, using mountains, valleys and the cover of darkness to avoid detection. The pod houses the first wide-field, forward-looking infrared navigation system for Air Force air-superiority fighters.\n\r\nThe targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared sensor (which displays an infrared image of the target to the pilot), a laser designator-rangefinder for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions, a missile boresight correlator for automatic lock-on of AGM-65D imaging infrared Maverick missiles, and software for automatic target tracking. These features simplify the functions of target detection, recognition and attack and permit pilots of single-seat fighters to attack targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass.\n\nBackground\r\nThe research and development program began in September 1980 with Martin Marietta Corp. (now Lockheed Martin, Inc.), Orlando, Fla., as contractor. Initial operational test and evaluation of the LANTIRN navigation pod was successfully completed in December 1984. The Air Force approved low-rate initial production of the navigation pod in March 1985 and full-rate production in November 1986. The first production pod was delivered to the Air Force March 31, 1987.\n\r\nIn April 1986, initial operational test and evaluation of the LANTIRN targeting pod proved that a low-altitude, night, under-the-weather, precision attack mission was feasible. The Air Force approved low-rate initial production in June 1986. Introduction of the LANTIRN revolutionized night warfare by denying enemy forces the sanctuary of darkness.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary function: Low altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night flying\nContractor: Lockheed Martin, Inc.\nLength: Navigation pod, 78.2 inches (1.99 meters); targeting pod, 98.5 inches (2.51 meters)\nDiameter: Navigation pod, 12 inches (.31 meters); targeting pod, 15 inches (.38 meters)\nWeight: Navigation pod, 451.1 pounds (204.6 kilograms); targeting pod, 530 pounds (240.7 kilograms)\nAircraft: F-15E, F-16C/D\nSensors: Infrared and terrain following radar sensors are on the navigation pod.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe LGM-30G Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, is an element of the nation's strategic deterrent forces under the control of the Air Force Global Strike Command. The \"L\" in LGM is the Department of Defense designation for silo-launched; \"G\" means surface attack; \"M\" stands for guided missile, the 30 stands for the Minuteman series of missile and the G after \u201c30\u201d is the current Minuteman III.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe Minuteman is a strategic weapon system using a ballistic missile of intercontinental range. Missiles are dispersed in hardened silos to protect against attack and connected to an underground launch control center through a system of hardened cables. Launch crews, consisting of two officers, perform around-the-clock alert in the launch control center.\n\r\nA variety of communication systems provide the president and secretary of defense with highly reliable, virtually instantaneous direct contact with each launch crew. Should command capability be lost between the launch control center and remote missile launch facilities, specially configured E-6B airborne launch control center aircraft automatically assume command and control of the isolated missile or missiles. Fully qualified airborne missile combat crews aboard airborne launch control center aircraft would execute the president's orders.\n\nBackground\r\nThe Minuteman weapon system was conceived in the late 1950s and Minuteman I was deployed in the early 1960s. Minuteman was a revolutionary concept and an extraordinary technical achievement. Both the missile and basing components incorporated significant advances beyond the relatively slow-reacting, liquid-fueled, remotely-controlled ICBMs of the previous generation. From the beginning, Minuteman missiles have provided a quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to America's strategic deterrent program. Minuteman's maintenance concept capitalizes on high reliability and a \"remove and replace\" approach to achieve a near 100 percent alert rate.\n\r\nThrough state-of-the-art improvements, the Minuteman system has evolved to meet new challenges and assume new missions. Modernization programs have resulted in new versions of the missile, expanded targeting options, improved accuracy and survivability. Today's Minuteman weapon system is the product of almost 60 years of continuous enhancement.\n\r\nThe current ICBM force consists of 400 Minuteman III missiles located at the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyo.; the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom AFB, Mont.; and the 91st Missile Wing at Minot AFB, N.D.\n\r\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Intercontinental ballistic missile\r\nContractor: Boeing Co.\r\nPower Plant: three solid-propellant rocket motors; First Stage ATK refurbished M55A1; Second Stage ATK refurbished SR-19; Third Stage ATK refurbished SR-73\r\nTechnologies Chemical Systems Division Thrust: First Stage: 203,158 pounds; Second Stage: 60,793 pounds; Third Stage: 35,086 pounds\r\nWeight: 79,432 pounds (36,030 kilograms)\r\nDiameter: 5.5 feet (1.67 meters)\r\nRange: 6,000-plus miles (5,218 nautical miles)\r\nSpeed: Approximately 15,000 mph (Mach 23 or 24,000 kph) at burnout\r\nCeiling: 700 miles (1,120 kilometers)\r\nDate deployed: June 1970, production cessation: December 1978\r\nInventory: active force, 400; Reserve, 0; ANG, 0\n\r\n(Current as of February 2019)\n\r\nPoint of Contact\r\nAir Force Global Strike Command, Public Affairs Office\r\n245 Davis Avenue East, Suite 198; Barksdale AFB, LA 71110\n318-456-7844 or\u00a0DSN: 781-1305\r\ne-mail: afgsc.paworkflow@us.af.mil"

    "title": "LITENING ADVANCE TARGETING",
    "description": "Mission\r\nLITENING Advanced Targeting, or AT, is a precision targeting pod system operational with a wide variety of combat air forces aircraft (A-10A/C, B-52H, F-15E and F-16 Blocks 25-52) as well as aircraft operated by other services and allies (AV-8B, EA-6B, F-16 Block 15\u00a0and F/A-18). The system's advanced targeting and image processing techology\u00a0significantly increases the combat effectiveness of the aircraft during day, night and under-the-weather conditions in the attack of ground targets with a variety of standoff weapons (i.e., laser-guided bombs, conventional bombs and GPS-guided weapons).\n\nFeatures\r\nMounted externally, \u00a0LITENING AT is a targeting pod integrated with the aircraft. The targeting pod contains a high-resolution, mid-wave third generation, forward-looking infrared sensor, or FLIR, that displays an infrared image of the target to the aircrew.\u00a0 It has a wide field of view search capability and a narrow field of view acquisition/targeting capability of battlefield-sized targets. The pod contains a charged coupled device or CCD-TV, camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. An on-gimbal inertial navigation sensor has established line-of-sight and automatic boresighting capability.\n\r\nThe\u00a0system incorporates a mult-spectral capability with a high resolution, mid-wave, third-generation\u00a0FLIR and CCD-TV.\u00a0 The pod is equipped with a laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions and\u00a0a laser rangefinder for precise target coordinates. For target coordination with ground and air forces, a laser spot tracker, a laser marker, and a fully operational remotely operated video enhanced receiver, or ROVER, compatible video down link improves rapid target detection/ identification.\n\r\nFor ease of maintenance, LITENING AT's\u00a0modularity, optimal hardware partitioning, and diagnostic capabilities permit true two-level maintenance, eliminating intermediate-level support. Automated built-in test permits a flightline maintainer to isolate and replace a line replaceable unit, or LRU, in under 20 minutes to get the pod back up to full mission capable status. Spares are ordered through a user-friendly website offering in-transit visibility to parts shipment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackground\r\nLITENING I was developed for the Israeli air force at Rafael Corporation's Missiles Division in Haifa, Israel. In 1995 Northrop Grumman Corporation's teamed with the company for further development.\u00a0\n\r\nLITENING II was initially fielded with\u00a0Air National Guard and\u00a0Air Force Reserve Command\u00a0F-16s in 1999 and employed a \"256\" FLIR. This was subsequently enhanced to the LITENING Enhanced Range, or ER, configuration by the incorporation of a third-generation \"512\" FLIR. Subsequent image processing enhancements led to the AT configuration\u00a0that is now the standard for U.S. forces which began fielding\u00a0in 2003.\u00a0\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary function:\u00a0 Infrared/electro-optical targeting; non-traditional intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance\nPrime Contractor: Northrop Grumman Corporation\u00a0\nLength: 87 inches (2.20 meters)\nDiameter: 16 inches (0.406 meters)\nWeight: 440 pounds (200 kilograms)\nAircraft: A-10A/A+/C, B-52H, F-15E, F-16 Block 25/30/32/40/42/50/52\nSensors: Infrared detector, CCD-TV camera, laser rangefinder and laser designator\nDate Deployed: February 2000\nUnit Cost: $1.4 million\n\r\n(Current as of August 2015)"

Also, the MC-130E landed in the Iranian desert in April 1980 in support of Operation Eagle Claw, the attempt to rescue American hostages held by Iran.\n\r\nCombat Talon IIs first arrived at Hurlburt Field, Florida, June 29, 1992, and after acceptance testing, began official flying operations Oct. 17, 1992. Since then, the MC-130H has played a vital role in AFSOC operations. Some of the aircraft's highlights include the evacuations of non-combatant Americans and other civilians from conflicts in Liberia in 1996. Also, in 1998, a Combat Talon II aircrew was awarded the Mackay Trophy for their involvement in the evacuation of civilians from the Republic of the Congo in 1997, and they participated in combat operations in the Balkans during Operation Allied Force.\n\r\nIn 2001, MC-130Hs were employed to seize an airfield in southern Afghanistan, delivering U.S. Army Rangers to commence ground operations in Operation Enduring Freedom. Later in 2003, the MC-130H was the first U.S. aircraft to land at Baghdad International Airport to initiate missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since October 2001, this aircraft has been used extensively in combat and humanitarian operations worldwide including operations Enduring Freedom and Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support, Tomodachi in Japan, Unified Response in Haiti, and Sahayogi Haat in Nepal.\n\r\nThe MC-130H is being replaced by the MC-130J Commando II.

    "description": "The Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, or MAFFS, Program provides emergency capability to supplement\u00a0existing commercial tanker support on wildland fires.\u00a0\u00a0MAFFS aids the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. When all other air tankers are activated but further assistance is needed, the Forest Service can request help from the \u00a0Air Force's MAFFS units.\u00a0 MAFFS is a mission that highlights interagency cooperation.\n\r\nMAFFS units fit inside C-130 airplanes without requiring structural modification. This allows the units to be loaded on short notice.\u00a0\u00a0It takes about two hours to load a MAFFS unit onto the C-130. The C-130s drop retardant from an altitude of about 150 feet through a discharge tube located in place of the left rear paratroop door of the aircraft.\r\nA MAFFS unit can discharge its load -- 3,000 gallons weighing 28,000 pounds -- in less than five seconds. The retardant covers an area one-quarter of a mile long and 60 feet wide. After the plane discharges its load, and returns to an air tanker base, it can be refilled and airborne again in less than\u00a020 minutes.\n\r\nMAFFS units can drop either water or retardant called \"slurry.\"\u00a0 Slurry is made of 80 to 85 percent water, 10 to 15 percent ammonium sulfate, a jelling agent and red coloring. The red in the retardant helps pilots see where they have dropped previous loads. Along with retarding the fire, the slurry acts as a fertilizer. Because the MAFFS discharges the agent in a mist, slurry does not cause damage to buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\r\nCrews who fly MAFFS missions participate in annual re-currency training. Each wing is required to have five certified crews for each MAFFS unit.\n\r\nIn the 1970s, Congress established the MAFFS system after a major fire burned into Long Beach, Calif., destroyed hundreds of homes, and overwhelmed the civilian tanker fleet's ability to respond. Today, one Air Force Reserve Command and\u00a0three Air National Guard locations participate in the MAFFS Program.\u00a0\n\r\nThe 302nd Airlift Wing in Colorado Springs, Colo., is the only Reserve unit. The Guard units include the145th AW in Charlotte, N.C.; the 146th AW in Channel Islands, Calif. and the 153rd AW in Cheyenne, Wyo. The 302nd AW has two of the MAFFS units and the Guard has\u00a0two units each for a total of eight systems nationwide."

    "description": "MissionThe MQ-1B Predator is an armed, multi-mission, medium-altitude, long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft that is employed primarily as an intelligence-collection asset and secondarily against dynamic execution targets. Given its significant loiter time, wide-range sensors, multi-mode communications suite, and precision weapons, it provides a unique capability to perform strike, coordination and reconnaissance (SCAR) against high-value, fleeting, and time-sensitive targets. Predators can also perform the following missions and tasks: intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, close air support, combat search and rescue, precision strike, buddy-lase, convoy/raid overwatch, route clearance, target development, and terminal air guidance. The MQ-1's capabilities make it uniquely qualified to conduct irregular warfare operations in support of combatant commander objectives.FeaturesThe Predator is part of a remotely piloted aircraft system. A fully operational system consists of four sensor/weapon-equipped aircraft, ground control station, Predator Primary Satellite Link, and spare equipment, along with operations and maintenance crews for deployed 24-hour missions.The basic crew for the Predator is a rated pilot to control the aircraft and command the mission, and an enlisted aircrew member to operate sensors and weapons as well as a mission coordinator, when required. The crew employs the aircraft from inside the ground control station via a line-of-sight data link or a satellite data link for beyond line-of-sight operations.The Predator carries the Multi-Spectral Targeting System, which integrates an infrared sensor, color/monochrome daylight TV camera, image-intensified TV camera, laser designator and laser illuminator. The full-motion video from each of the imaging sensors can be viewed as separate video streams or fused. The aircraft can employ two laser-guided missiles, Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire, that possess highly accurate, low-collateral damage, and anti-armor, anti-personnel engagement capabilities.The remotely piloted aircraft system can be deployed for worldwide operations; likewise, the Predator can be disassembled and loaded into a container for travel. The ground control system and PPSL are transportable in a C-130 Hercules (or larger) transport aircraft. The Predator can operate on a 5,000 by 75-foot (1,524 meters by 23 meters) hard-surface runway with clear line-of-sight to the ground data terminal antenna. The antenna provides line-of-sight communications for takeoff and landing. The PPSL provides over-the-horizon communications for the aircraft and sensors.The primary concept of operations, remote split operations, employs a launch-and-recovery ground control element for take-off and landing operations at the forward operating location, while the crew based in the continental United States executes command and control of the remainder of the mission via beyond-line-of-sight links. Remote split operations result in a smaller number of personnel deployed to a forward location, consolidate control of the different flights in one location, and as such, simplify command and control functions as well as the logistical supply challenges for the weapons system.The aircraft has an ARC-210 radio, APX-100 IFF/SIF with Mode 4, and upgraded turbocharged engine.

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe Reaper is employed primarily as an intelligence-collection asset and secondarily against dynamic execution targets. Given its significant loiter time, wide-range sensors, multi-mode communications suite, and precision weapons, it provides a unique capability to perform strike, coordination, and reconnaissance against high-value, fleeting, and time-sensitive targets.\n\r\nReapers can also perform the following missions and tasks: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, close air support, combat search and rescue, precision strike, buddy-lase, convoy and raid overwatch, route clearance, target development, and terminal air guidance. The MQ-9's capabilities make it uniquely qualified to conduct irregular warfare operations in support of combatant commander objectives.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe Reaper is part of a remotely piloted aircraft system. A fully operational system consists of sensor and weapon-equipped aircraft, ground control station, Predator Primary Satellite Link\u00a0and spare equipment along with operations and maintenance crews for deployed 24-hour missions.\n\r\nThe basic crew consists of a rated pilot to control the aircraft and command the mission, and an enlisted aircrew member to operate sensors and guide weapons. To meet combatant commanders' requirements, the Reaper delivers tailored capabilities using mission kits containing various weapons and sensor payload combinations.\n\r\nThe MQ-9 baseline system carries the Multi-Spectral Targeting System, which has a robust suite of visual sensors for targeting. The MTS-B integrates an infrared sensor, color, monochrome daylight TV camera, shortwave infrared camera, laser designator, and laser illuminator. The full-motion video from each of the imaging sensors can be viewed as separate video streams or fused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MQ-9 Reaper flies a training mission over the Nevada Test and Training Range, July 15, 2019.

The Reaper is also equipped with a synthetic aperture radar. The MQ-9 can also employ up to eight laser-guided missiles, Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire, which possess highly accurate, low-collateral damage, anti-armor and anti-personnel engagement capabilities.\n\r\nThe remotely piloted aircraft can be disassembled and loaded into a single container for deployment worldwide. The entire system can be transported in the C-130 Hercules or larger aircraft. The MQ-9 aircraft operates from standard U.S. airfields with clear line-of-sight to the ground data terminal antenna, which provides line-of-sight communications for takeoff and landing. The PPSL provides over-the-horizon communications for the aircraft and sensors.\n\r\nThe MQ-9 has also been modified for extended range operations through the addition of external fuel tanks capable of holding 1,300 lbs of fuel. This provides for greater on station time and further range. The modification also adds an extra blade to the propeller and an alcohol-water injection system to improve takeoff performance.\n\r\nThe primary concept of operations, remote split operations, employs a launch-and-recovery ground control station for take-off and landing operations at the forward operating location, while the crew based in continental United States executes command and control of the remainder of the mission via beyond-line-of-sight links. Remote split operations result in a smaller number of personnel deployed to a forward location, consolidates control of the different flights to stateside locations, and as such, simplifies command and control functions as well as the logistical supply challenges for the weapons system.\n\nBackground\r\nThe U.S. Air Force proposed the MQ-9 Reaper system in response to the Department of Defense directive to support initiatives of overseas contingency operations. It is larger and more powerful than the MQ-1 Predator, and is designed to execute time-sensitive targets with persistence and precision, and destroy or disable those targets. The \"M\" is the DoD designation for multi-role, and \"Q\" means remotely piloted aircraft system.

    "title": "OC-135B Open Skies",
    "description": "Mission The United States of America Open Skies OC-135B Observation Aircraft supports the Open Skies Treaty. The aircraft flies unarmed observation flights over participating parties of the treaty.\n\nFeatures \r\nThe aircraft is a modified WC-135B. Since its primary mission is to take pictures, most of the installed equipment and systems provide direct support to the cameras and the camera operator. Work on the aircraft also included installing an auxiliary power unit, crew luggage compartment, sensor operator console, flight following console and upgraded avionics.\n\r\nThe interior seats 35 people, including the cockpit crew, aircraft maintenance crew, foreign country representatives and crew members from the Department of Defense's Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\r\nCameras installed include one vertical and two oblique KS-87E framing cameras used for low-altitude photography (approximately 3,000 feet above the ground), and one KA-91C panoramic camera, which scans from side to side to provide a wide sweep for each picture (used for high altitude photography at approximately 35,000 feet).\n\r\nThe integrated data annotation and recording system, or IDARMS, processes navigational, altitude, time and camera signals to annotate each picture with correct position, altitude, time, roll angle and other information. In addition, this system records every picture taken according to camera, frame and navigational position and downloads this data to a thumbdrive. A keyboard with trackball is the input device for operation of this system. Two Barco 12-inch VGA color monitors display camera annotation and other camera data on screen for the sensor operator and observer use.\n\r\nCamera control, located in the sensor operator's console, operates and adjusts individual cameras for cloud cover, frame overlap and other functions. The sensor operator console seats four and has all the equipment listed above plus camera bay heating control, chronometers, emergency oxygen, interphone and individual lighting. The flight following console also seats four and includes most of the equipment listed above except for IDARMS and camera controls.\r\nSeven commercial Norcoid Tek II coolers with individual refrigeration units maintain temperature and humidity control to maintain peak film performance. The units can be removed, if necessary, from the aircraft in order to transport film. The coolers are capable of storing 40,000 feet of film.\n\r\nThe aircraft flies on its intended flight path throughout the entire mission with no reliance on ground-based navigation devices. A top-of-the-line commercial system, Litton 92 INS/GPS, which is an integrated inertial navigation system with a global positioning system or GPS, provides continuous updates. The GPS updates the INS several times per second to correct any deviations in the flight path. The INS also feeds precise latitude, longitude, time, roll angle and barometric altitude to the IDARMS and camera systems. A true airspeed computer feeds true airspeed data to the INS.\n\r\nA combined altitude radar altimeter provides precise height above ground information to the pilot for navigational purposes as well as a signal to IDARMS for film annotation. It is accurate from 0 to 50,000 feet above the ground level. Plus, a metric altimeter is installed on the pilot's instrument panel for altitude reference when flying in countries that use meters for altitude reference.\n\r\nThe aircraft have been upgraded with the Block 40.5 Pacer Crag Navigational System, a first step in making them compliant with ICAO mandated Global Air Traffic Management and Global Air Navigation Standards guidelines.\n\r\nOther modifications support the aircrew. A gaseous oxygen system replaced the liquid oxygen system to be more compatible with foreign airfields, and fluorescent lighting system was added throughout the cabin to provide adequate lighting for operation and inspections. Four upgraded seats with a conference table, interphone, lighting and oxygen system comprise the mission commanders' station for both country's mission commanders.\n\nBackground \r\nThe Open Skies Treaty was first proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower to Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev at the Geneva Conference of 1955. The Soviets rejected the concept and it lay dormant for a generation. In May 1989, the U.S. reintroduced the idea of Open Skies as an instrument of confidence building.\n\r\nThe Treaty enhances mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participating countries, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. It permits short-notice, unrestricted aerial observation flights over the territory of each signatory.\n\r\nThe aircraft are assigned to Air Combat Command at the 55 Wing, 45th Reconnaissance Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., for operations, training and maintenance. When tasked, ACC 's role is to transport a DTRA observation team to an Open Skies point of entry airport, and conduct the observation flight, then return the team to the continental United States.\n\r\nThree OC-135Bs were modified by the Aeronautical Systems Center's 4950th Test Wing at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The first initial operational capability (IOC) OC-135B was assigned to the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron, at Offutt AFB, Neb., in October 1993. The IOC aircraft was placed in permanent storage at Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis Monthan AFB, Ariz. Two fully operational OC-135B aircraft were delivered in 1996.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Support Open Skies Treaty\nContractor: Boeing Military Airplanes Div.\nPower Plant: Four Pratt & Whitney TF33-P-5 Turbofans with thrust reversers\nThrust: 16,050 pounds each engine\nWingspan: 131 feet (39.9 meters)\nLength: 135 feet (41.1 meters)\nHeight: 42 feet (12.8 meters)\nWeight: 126,400 (57,334 kilograms)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 297,000 pounds (133,633 kilograms)\nFuel Capacity: 130,000 pounds (58,967 kilograms)\nSpeed: 500+ miles per hour (Mach.9)\nRange: 4,050 miles (6,500 kilometers) unrefueled\nCrew: (flight crew), seven (augmented crew) - three pilots, two navigators, and two sensor maintenance technicians; (DTRA mission flight crew), one mission commander, one deputy mission commander, two sensor operators and one flight follower\nUnit Cost: unavailable\nInitial operating capability: October 1993\nInventory: Active force, 2; Reserve, 0; Guard, 0\n\r\n(Current as of April 2014)"

OTS is a group-level command with three squadrons that graduated over 2,200 officers in fiscal year 2023. OTS graduates enter the Air Force in all components: Active Duty, Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard. OTS is also responsible for commissioning U.S. Space Force Officers.\n\r\nThe $78 million OTS Complex at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, consists of two academic buildings with auditoriums, four dormitories, dining facility, physical conditioning center, parade field, running track and sports fields. Additionally, OTS maintains an Air Expeditionary Force garrison training site, a 200-acre field training facility, confidence course and two expeditionary assault courses.\n\nHistory\r\nThe United States Air Force initiated OTS at Medina Annex, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, in 1959. The school subsequently moved to Maxwell AFB in September 1993 as part of the Air Force Chief of Staff's vision to align all officer education and training programs under Air University. Its predecessor, the Officer Candidate School, was established in 1942 at Miami Beach, Florida, with the mission of training and commissioning officers from within the enlisted ranks. OCS moved to Lackland AFB in the spring of 1944 and gained the additional mission of training officers directly from civilian status in September 1951. OCS closed its doors with its last graduation in June 1963. The first OTS class was comprised of 89 trainees, including 11 women. Accession numbers have varied over the years from 323 the first year, to a high of 7,894 officers in 1967.\n\nOfficer Training\r\nThe purpose of OTS is to train and develop new officers to fulfill Air Force and Space Force active duty, Reserve and Air National Guard requirements, in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. Accession numbers fluctuate in response to variations between projected and actual U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC officer accessions and Air Force and Space Force end strength requirements.\n\r\nThe program consists of 30 hours of pre-requisite distance learning and eight weeks of military training and leadership development for college graduates. The purpose of the course is to build the foundation necessary to produce warrior-minded leaders of character. The course outcomes include, warfighting understanding, effective communication, leadership application and appreciation of the profession of arms.\n\r\nSome health professionals (doctors, dentists and highly specialized nurses) and medical scholarship recipients will attend the first 5 weeks of the training and off ramp after completing all graduation requirements.\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a 15-day Reserve Commissioned Officer Orientation program for extremely difficult to recruit Reserve medical officers as determined by their respective functional managers. This course is offered two times per year.\n\r\nThe program consists of five modules that build upon each other and emphasis teamwork, communication, decision-making, resiliency, creative thinking and accountability. Lectures, guided discussions, classroom exercises, field leadership exercises and after-hours training activities combine to provide graduates with an in-depth understanding of their roles as future commissioned officers in the Air Force. The program also features two \"Air Expeditionary Force Exercises,\" both assessing field leadership and the ability to integrate and apply the communication and leadership skills learned throughout the course.\n\r\nMost of these new officers attend follow-on training after OTS. Training specialties include pilot, navigator, air battle manager; space, missile operations; and several other career fields. The length of training varies according to the specialty.\n\nMotto and Ethos\r\nOTS\u2019s motto is \"Always with Honor,\" reflected in the school\u2019s ethos statement. As OTS professionals, we are dedicated to owning the mission. We will purposefully develop as leaders within the profession of arms with pride, passion and unity. We will teach and be taught. We will lead and be led. We will identify and push beyond our perceived limits through courage, resiliency and hardiness of spirit. We will model the way with a relentless pursuit of excellence...Always with Honor!\n\nFor More Information\r\nFor more information on OTS, visit the OTS web site at http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Holm-Center/OTS/.

    "description": "Pacific Air Forces, headquartered at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, is a major command of the U.S. Air Force and is the air component of the U.S. Pacific Command.\u00a0MissionPACAF's primary mission is to provide U.S. Pacific Command integrated expeditionary Air Force capabilities to defend the Homeland, promote stability, dissuade/deter aggression, and swiftly defeat enemies.The command's vision is to bring the full power of America's Air Force and the skill of its Airmen to promote peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0\u00a0PACAF's area of responsibility extends from the west coast of the United States to the east coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, covering more than 100 million square miles. The area is home to 50 percent of the world's population in 36 nations and over one-third of the global economic output. The unique location of the Strategic Triangle (Hawaii-Guam-Alaska) gives our nation persistent presence and options to project U.S. airpower from sovereign territory.\u00a0Personnel and Resources\u00a0The command has approximately 45,000 military and civilian personnel serving in nine strategic locations and numerous smaller facilities, primarily in Hawaii, Alaska, Japan, Guam and the Republic of Korea. Approximately 340 fighter and attack aircraft are assigned to the command with approximately 100 additional deployed aircraft rotating on Guam. PACAF will be home to three of the seven F-22 fighter squadrons currently programmed, and is already home to the only two C-17 units based outside the continental United States.Approximately 2,100 PACAF Airmen are deployed at any given time in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations, many participating in non-traditional missions such as convoy and detainee operations\u00a0Organization PACAF's major units are 5th Air Force, Yokota Air Base, Japan; 7th Air Force, Osan AB, Republic of Korea; 11th Air Force, and Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.\u00a0Major units also include 3rd Wing, Elmendorf AFB; 8th Fighter Wing, Kunsan AB, Republic of Korea; 15th Airlift Wing, Hickam AFB; 18th Wing, Kadena AB, Japan (Okinawa); 51st Fighter Wing, Osan AB; 354th Fighter Wing, Eielson AFB, Alaska; 35th Fighter Wing, Misawa AB, Japan; 374th Airlift Wing, Yokota AB; and the 36th Wing, Andersen AFB, Guam.\u00a0HistoryPACAF traces its roots to the activation of Far East Air Forces, Aug. 3, 1944, at Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. FEAF was subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces Far East and served as the headquarters of Allied Air Forces Southwest Pacific Area. By 1945, three numbered air forces -- 5th, 7th and 13th -- were supporting operations in the Pacific. At that time, the Army Air Forces in the Pacific became part of the largest and most powerful military organization ever fielded by any country in the world.After World War II, FEAF and 5th Air Force remained in Japan, while 7th Air Force operated from Hawaii, and 13th Air Force operated from the Philippines. In the post-war years, FEAF was designated the theater air force for the Far East Command. All air forces in the Far East andSouthwest Pacific were placed under one Air Force commander for the first time.When the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel June 25, 1950, FEAF consisted of 5th Air Force, 13th Air Force, 20th Air Force and the Far East Materiel Command. Four years after the Korean War armistice, FEAF was redesignated Pacific Air Forces and transferred its headquarters to Hickam.By 1960, PACAF maintained a combat-ready deterrent force of some 35 squadrons, operating from 10 major bases in a half-dozen countries. In the early 1960s communist military strength and firepower in Vietnam increased. As a result, PACAF began a buildup in the area with the addition of troops and better arms and equipment.Combat aircraft of PACAF flew their last strikes in Cambodia Aug. 15, 1973, writing the final chapter to the long and costly history of active American participation in the Indochina War. The post-Vietnam era found the command focusing on improving its readiness.PACAF's organizational structure saw a marked period of rapid and extensive changes. Andersen AFB was reassigned from Strategic Air Command in 1989, and 11th Air Force became a part of the command in late 1990. Following the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Clark AB, the Philippines, was closed and 13th Air Force relocated to Andersen in 1991. In 1992, changes took place in force structure within PACAF as the command assumed control of theater-based tactical airlift wings, theater C-130 aircraft and crews, and associated theater C-130 support. PACAF also gained control of all operational support aircraft and all aeromedical airlift assets in the Pacific.Throughout its history PACAF has played a vital role in world events. In addition to its key combat role in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, PACAF units fought in Desert Storm in 1991, and they continue to deploy to Iraq, Afghanistan, the Philippines and other locations in support of contingency operations. PACAF provided its expertise, aircraft, personnel and equipment to facilitate the new Expeditionary Air Force, especially as it applied to successful airbridge operations spanning the vast Pacific Ocean. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, PACAF again demonstrated its intrepid spirit through its units deployed in support of operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.Since 1944, the command has participated in more than 140 humanitarian operations within its area of responsibility and beyond. In these operations PACAF personnel quickly and efficiently airlifted food, medicine and other supplies to areas devastated by storms, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes and other natural disasters.Additionally, the command supported three of the largest evacuations ever undertaken by the Air Force: the Newlife evacuation of the Vietnamese in 1975, the Fiery Vigil evacuation of Clark AB, Philippines, after the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and the Pacific Haven operation to support and resettle Kurdish evacuees in 1997.\u00a0Recent efforts include support of tsunami relief efforts during Operation Unified Assistance in 2006. PACAF stood up a 24/7 air operations center to organize rescue and relief flight efforts by the Air Force as well as Navy, Marine, Coast Guard and other nations. In 2008, PACAF delivered winter supplies and food to China to help victims of China's worst winter storms in more than 50 years. PACAF also delivered 2,000,000 pounds of relief supplies after China was hit by a devastating earthquake and assisted with Burma cyclone relief by preparing C-17s to transport personnel and supplies.On Sept. 28, 2012, 13th Air Force was inactivated and combined with the staff of Pacific AirForces at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.For more than five decades PACAF has served in defense of the nation. The command continually prepares to bring air power quickly and decisively to the far reaches of the Pacific.\u00a0Point of ContactPacific Air Forces, Public Affairs Office; (808) 448-3218\u00a025 E Street, Suite G-108Hickam AFB, Hawaii 96853-5496(Current as of October 2015)"

    "description": "Mission\u00a0\r\nThe RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft with an integrated sensor suite that provides global all-weather, day or night intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability. Global Hawk's mission is to provide a broad spectrum of ISR collection capability to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations. The Global Hawk provides persistent near-real-time coverage using imagery intelligence (IMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT) and moving target indicator (MTI) sensors.\u00a0\n\nFeatures\u00a0\r\nGlobal Hawk is currently fielded in three distinct blocks. Seven Block 10 aircraft were procured, but were retired from the Air Force inventory in 2011. Block 20s were initially fielded with IMINT-only capabilities, but three Block 20s have been converted to an EQ-4 communication relay configuration, carrying the Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) payload. Block 30 is a multi-intelligence platform that simultaneously carries electro-optical, infrared, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and high and low band SIGINT sensors. Block 30 Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was declared in August 2011. Eighteen Block 30s are currently fielded, supporting every geographic combatant command as well as combat missions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom/ New Dawn. Block 30s also supported Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya and humanitarian relief efforts during Operation Tomodachi in Japan. Block 40 carries the Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) active electronically scanned array radar which provides MTI and SAR data. Block 40 Early Operating Capability (EOC) was declared in Sep 2013 and eleven Block 40s are currently fielded, supporting operations in four combatant commands. \u00a0IOC is projected in 2015.\u00a0\n\r\nGlobal Hawk is flown by a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) and a Mission Control Element (MCE). The LRE is located at the aircraft base and functions to launch and recover the aircraft while en route to and from the target area. The MCE controls the Global Hawk for the bulk of the ISR mission. Like the LRE, the MCE is manned by one pilot, but adds a sensor operator to the crew. Command and control data links enable complete dynamic control of the aircraft. The pilot workstations in the MCE and LRE are the control and display interface (cockpit) providing aircraft health and status, sensors status and a means to alter the navigational track of the aircraft. From this station, the pilot also communicates with outside entities to coordinate the mission (air traffic control, airborne controllers, ground controllers, other ISR assets).\u00a0\n\r\nThe sensor operator workstation provides capability to task the sensor, dynamically update the collection plan in real time, initiate sensor calibration and monitor sensor status. The sensor operator also assists the exploitation node with image quality control, target deck prioritization and scene tracking to ensure fluid operations.\n\r\nThe system offers a wide variety of employment options. The unmatched range and 30+ hour endurance allow tremendous flexibility in meeting mission requirements. \u00a0In 2014, an RQ-4 Block 40 flew a 34.3 hour flight, setting the endurance record for longest unrefueled flight by a U.S. Air Force aircraft.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn RQ-4 Global Hawk takes off Oct. 24, 2018, at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy.

    "description": "Mission\n\r\nSpecial reconnaissance Airmen are special tactics operators with unique training to conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance across the spectrum of conflict with focus on lethal and non-lethal air-to-ground integration of airpower. They deploy rapidly and undetected by any means, anytime and anywhere to systematically \u2013 and with impunity \u2013 obtain, transmit, exploit and action time-sensitive information. U.S. Air Force special reconnaissance employs as an element of special tactics teams to prepare the environment, ensure global battlespace awareness, provide global access and affect air, space, cyberspace and information superiority for the successful execution of Joint Force objectives.\n\nHistory\n\r\nThe U.S. Army Weather Service originated in 1917 to provide the American Expeditionary Forces with \"all the meteorological information needed; and to undertake special investigations in military meteorology and related problems.\" They first took part in World War I combat operations in France in 1918 within the Army\u2019s Signal Corps.\n\r\nDuring World War II, specially trained weather observers, sometimes referred to as guerrilla weathermen, infiltrated behind enemy lines to provide intelligence in support of air strikes, airlifts and airdrops. In every conflict since Vietnam, special operations weathermen have participated in the majority of special operations missions, conducting austere environmental reconnaissance operations, and setting conditions critical to the success of follow-on forces.\n\r\nOn May 5, 2008, the Air Force approved the establishment of a new Air Force Specialty Code for special operations weather teams (SOWT), formally recognizing the requirement for a special reconnaissance capability, uniquely trained to conduct weather operations and to collect and analyze environmental reconnaissance. These operators have since been an integral part of special tactics able to conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance across the spectrum of conflict and crisis.\r\nBeginning in 2016, Headquarters Air Force and Air Force Special Operations Command recognized the need to look critically at the entire formation. Recognition of the Air Force\u2019s challenges in an era of great power competition drove the evolution of special tactics teams.\r\nOn April 30, 2019, SOWT transitioned to special reconnaissance, expanding the capabilities and lethality of Air Force special tactics. Special reconnaissance will continue to maintain their application of lethal and non-lethal air-to-ground integration of airpower. Additionally, they will focus their primary skill set on reconnaissance \u2013 long cultivated within their community \u2013 into a multi-domain, tactical capability able to provide battlespace awareness, and generate effects of strategic and operational significance.\n\nHighly trained air commandos\n\r\nSpecial reconnaissance Airmen are among the most highly trained personnel in the U.S. military.

    "description": "World War II had been over for two years and the Korean War lay three years ahead when the Air Force ended a 40-year association with the U.S. Army to become a separate service. The U.S. Air Force thus entered a new era in which airpower became firmly established as a major element of the nation's defense and one of its chief hopes for deterring war.\n\r\nThe Department of the Air Force was created when President Harry S Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947. It became effective Sept. 18, 1947, when Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson administered the oath of office to the first secretary of the Air Force, W. Stuart Symington, a position filled by presidential appointment.\n\r\nUnder the National Security Act, the functions assigned to the Army Air Force's commanding general transferred to the Department of the Air Force. The act provided for an orderly two-year transfer of these functions as well as property, personnel and records.\n\r\nLater, under the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1958, the departments of Army, Navy and Air Force were eliminated from the chain of operational command. Commanders of unified and specified commands became responsible to the president and the secretary of defense through the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The act redefined the functions of the military departments to those of essentially organizing, training, equipping and supporting combat forces for the unified and specified commands. Each military department retained resource management of its service.\n\nAir Force Vision\r\nThe United States Air Force will be a trusted and reliable joint partner with our sister services known for integrity in all of our activities, including supporting the joint mission first and foremost. We will provide compelling air, space, and cyber capabilities for use by the combatant commanders. We will excel as stewards of all Air Force resources in service to the American people, while providing precise and reliable Global Vigilance, Reach and Power for the nation.\n\nAir Force Mission\r\nThe mission of the U. S. Air Force is: To fly, fight, and win\u2026airpower anytime, anywhere.\n\nAir Force Management\r\nThe Department of the Air Force incorporates all elements of the U.S. Air Force. It is administered by a civilian secretary appointed by the president and is supervised by a military chief of staff. The Secretariat and Air Staff help the secretary and the chief of staff direct the Air Force mission.\n\r\nTo assure unit preparedness and overall effectiveness of the Air Force, the secretary of the Air Force is responsible for and has the authority to conduct all affairs of the Department of the Air Force. This includes training, operations, administration, logistical support and maintenance, and welfare of personnel. The secretary's responsibilities include research and development, and any other activity prescribed by the president or the secretary of defense.\n\r\nThe secretary of the Air Force exercises authority through civilian assistants and the chief of staff, but retains immediate supervision of activities that involve vital relationships with Congress, the secretary of defense, other governmental officials and the public.\n\r\nPrincipal civilian assistants within the Secretariat are the\u00a0assistant secretary for acquisition,\u00a0assistant secretary for manpower and Reserve affairs, assistant secretary for installations, environment and logistics, and assistant secretary for financial management and comptroller.\n\r\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Air Force includes a general counsel, auditor general, inspector general, administrative assistant, public affairs director, legislative liaison director, small business director, warfighting integration and chief information officer, and certain statutory boards and committees.\n\nThe Air Staff\r\nThe chief of staff, U.S. Air Force, is appointed by the president, with the consent of the Senate, from among Air Force general officers - normally for a four-year term. The chief of staff serves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Armed Forces Policy Council. In the JCS capacity, the chief is one of the military advisers to the president, the National Security Council and the secretary of defense. Also, the chief is the principal adviser to the secretary of the Air Force on Air Force activities.\n\r\nThe chief of staff presides over the Air Staff, transmits Air Staff plans and recommendations to the secretary of the Air Force and acts as the secretary's agent in carrying them out. The chief is responsible for the efficiency of the Air Force and the preparation of its forces for military operations. The chief of staff supervises the administration of Air Force personnel assigned to unified organizations and unified and specified commands. Also, the chief supervises support of these forces assigned by the Air Force as directed by the secretary of defense. In addition, the chief of staff has responsibility for activities assigned to the Air Force by the secretary of defense.\n\r\nOther members of the Air Staff are the vice chief of staff, assistant vice chief of staff, chief master sergeant of the Air Force, deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel, deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, deputy chief of staff for operations, plans and requirements,\u00a0deputy chief of staff for logistics,\u00a0installations and mission support, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and programs,\u00a0\u00a0assistant chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, chief of safety, director of analyses, assessments and lessons learned, judge advocate general, director of test and evaluation, surgeon general, Air Force historian, chief scientist, chief of the Air Force Reserve, chief of the National Guard Bureau, and chief of chaplain service.\n\nField Organizations \r\nThe\u00a0ten major commands,\u00a0field operating agencies,\u00a0direct reporting units and their subordinate elements constitute the field organization that carries out the Air Force mission. In addition, there are two Reserve components, the Air Force Reserve, which is also a major command, and the Air National Guard.\n\r\nMajor commands are organized on a functional basis in the United States and a geographic basis overseas. They accomplish designated phases of Air Force worldwide activities. Also, they organize, administer, equip and train their subordinate elements for the accomplishment of assigned missions. Major commands generally are assigned specific responsibilities based on functions. In descending order of command, elements of major commands include numbered air forces, wings, groups, squadrons and flights.\n\r\nThe basic unit for generating and employing combat capability is the wing, which has always been the Air Forces prime war-fighting instrument. Composite wings operate more than one kind of aircraft, and may be configured as self-contained units designated for quick air intervention anywhere in the world. Other wings continue to operate a single aircraft type ready to join air campaigns anywhere they are needed. Air base and specialized mission wings such as training, intelligence and test also support the Air Force mission. Within the wing, operations, logistics and support groups are the cornerstones of the organization.\n\r\nField operating agencies and direct reporting units are other Air Force subdivisions and report directly to Headquarters U.S. Air Force. They are assigned a specialized mission that is restricted in scope when compared to the mission of a major command. Field operating agencies carry out field activities under the operational control of a Headquarters U.S. Air Force functional manager. Direct reporting units are not under the operational control of a Headquarters U.S. Air Force functional manager because of a unique mission, legal requirements or other factors.\n\nMajor Commands\r\nAir Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, Va.\n\r\nAir Education and Training Command, Randolph AFB, Texas\n\r\nAir Force Global Strike Command,\u00a0Barksdale AFB, La.\n\r\nAir Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio\n\r\nAir Force Reserve Command, Robins AFB, Ga.\n\r\nAir Force Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colo.\n\r\nAir Force Special Operations Command, Hurlburt Field, Fla.\n\r\nAir Mobility Command, Scott AFB, Ill.\n\r\nPacific Air Forces, Hickam AFB, Hawaii\n\r\nU.

The squadron exhibits the professional qualities the Air Force develops in the people who fly, maintain and support these aircraft.\n\r\nObjectives of the squadron are:\r\n- To support Air Force recruiting and retention programs\r\n- To reinforce public confidence in the Air Force and to demonstrate to the public the professional competence of Air Force members\r\n- To strengthen morale and esprit de corps among Air Force members\r\n- To support Air Force community relations and people-to-people programs\r\n- To represent the United States and its armed forces to foreign nations and to project international goodwill\n\nThe Team\r\nThe Thunderbirds squadron is an Air Combat Command unit composed of eight pilots (including six demonstration pilots), four support officers, three civilians and more than 130 enlisted personnel performing in 25 career fields.\n\r\nA Thunderbirds air demonstration is a mix of formation flying and solo routines. The four-aircraft diamond formation demonstrates the training and precision of Air Force pilots, while the solo aircraft highlight the maximum capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\r\nThe pilots perform approximately 30 maneuvers in a demonstration. The entire show, including ground and air, runs about an hour and fifteen minutes. The season lasts from March to November, with the winter months used to train new members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thunderbirds, the Air Force's flight demonstration squadron, perform during the Cleveland National Air Show in Cleveland, Sept. 6, 2021.

Replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year, providing a constant mix of experience.\n\r\nThe squadron performs approximately 75\u00a0demonstrations each year and has never canceled a demonstration due to maintenance difficulty. More than\u00a0300 million people in all 50 states and 58 foreign countries have seen the red, white and blue jets in more than 4,000 aerial demonstrations.\n\r\nIn addition to their responsibilities as the official U.S. Air Force aerial demonstration team, the Thunderbirds are part of our combat force. If required, the team's personnel and aircraft can be rapidly integrated into a fighter unit at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. Since the aircraft are only slightly modified, they can be made combat-ready in less than 72 hours.\n\nF-16 Fighting Falcon\r\nThe Lockheed Martin (formerly General Dynamics) F-16 represents the full range of capabilities possessed by the Air Force's tactical fighters. This highly maneuverable multi-role fighter has proven to be one of the world's best precision tactical bombers and air-to-air combat aircraft. The only modifications needed to prepare the aircraft for its air demonstration role are installing a smoke-generating system in the space normally reserved for the 20mm cannon, and the painting of the aircraft in Thunderbird colors.\n\nHistory\r\nThe Thunderbirds were officially activated June 1, 1953, as the 3600th Air Demonstration Team at Luke AFB, Ariz. Their first aircraft was the straight-winged F-84G Thunderjet, a combat fighter-bomber that had seen action in Korea. Early in 1955 the team transitioned to the swept-winged F-84F Thunderstreak.\n\r\nIn June 1956, the team moved to its current home at Nellis. At the same time theThunderbirds traded the veteran F-84 for the world's first supersonic fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre -- an aerial platform that would serve the Thunderbirds for 13 years. More than 1,000 demonstrations were flown in the Super Sabre, thrilling spectators around the world. The team changed briefly to the Republic F-105 Thunderchief. After only six shows, in 1964, due to an extensive modification that became necessary on all Thunderchiefs, the Thunderbirds returned to the F-100.\n\r\nFrom 1969 to 1973, the Thunderbirds flew the Air Force's front-line fighter, the F-4E Phantom. In 1974, the Thunderbirds converted to the T-38 Talon, the world's first supersonic trainer. The T-38 was more fuel-efficient and less costly to maintain than the larger F-4.\n\r\nEarly in 1983, the Thunderbirds reinstituted their traditional role of demonstrating the Air Force's front-line fighter capabilities. Transition to the F-16A allowed the team to retain manpower and fuel efficiency while demonstrating to spectators the latest in fighter technology.\n\r\nIn 1986, the Thunderbirds participated in the rededication flyby of the Statue of Liberty and in September, another milestone was attained when the team went over the 200 million mark for total attendance.\n\r\nThe largest crowd, 2.25 million people, to see a performance was at Coney Island, N.Y., July 4, 1987. The 1987 Far East tour marked their debut in Beijing, China -- the first American military demonstration performance in a Communist country.\n\r\nOperation Desert Storm cancelled the 1990 European tour and the season was shortened. The team converted to the F-16C in 1992, bringing the F-16A era to an end.\n\r\n\u00a0In July 1996, the team participated in opening ceremonies of the Centennial Olympics held in Atlanta which were viewed by an estimated 3.5 billion people around the world.\n\r\nThe Thunderbirds made television history in 2003 while celebrating their 50th Anniversary. The commander/leader started the Coca-Cola 600 by broadcasting live from Thunderbird No. 1 as he said, \"Gentlemen, start your engines.\"\n\r\nIn 2007, the Thunderbirds visited Europe for the first time since Sept. 11, 2001 with the European Goodwill Tour. The trip included shows in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom - and for the first time in Thunderbird history - Ireland.\n\r\nIn 2009, the Thunderbirds traveled back to the Pacific Rim, performing in locations like Malaysia, Guam, Australia, Korea and Japan. The team performed more than 70 shows in 22 states and Puerto Rico.\n\r\nThe 2010 season, the team's 57th year of performing, saw the team in 73 shows all over the United States and Canada. Spending more than 250 days on the road representing Airmen,\u00a0millions of people have witnessed the Thunderbird demonstrations. In turn, they've seen the pride, professionalism and dedication of hundreds of thousands of Airmen serving at home and abroad. Each year brings another opportunity for the team to represent those who deserve the most credit: the everyday, hard-working Airmen voluntarily serving America and defending freedom."

During each annual tour, Tops In Blue entertains more than 250,000 military personnel and their families, presenting an average of 120 performances at 100 locations worldwide. The showcase is presented throughout the continental United States, Canada, Europe, Central America, Alaska and the Pacific.\n\nOrganization\n\r\nEach year, active-duty men and women with military duties as diverse as aircraft mechanics, electronic technicians, security specialists and other functional areas begin at base level by competing in talent shows. The most talented are then selected to compete at the Air Force Worldwide Talent Contest. From these contestants, a 30-member group is chosen to represent the best of the best.\n\r\nAlthough contestants strive to be selected for Tops In Blue during the competition, they also compete in one of five individual categories to be the best in the Air Force. These include male and female vocalist, instrumentalist, and musical and non-musical variety categories. A contestant's age or rank is not a limiting factor. Talent category winners have ranged from lieutenant colonels and senior master sergeants with more than 20 years of service to second lieutenants and airmen basic with fewer than six months of service. Most contestants, however, are junior officers and staff sergeants and below.\n\r\nAll contestants must have their commanders' approval to allow them to travel with Tops In Blue.\n\nManagement\n\r\nTops In Blue is produced by the Entertainment Branch of the Programs Directorate, Headquarters Air Force Services Agency, San Antonio. These programs are funded in part by appropriated funds and supplemented with nonappropriated funds that are generated by Air Force people.\n\nHistory\n\r\nTops In Blue began in 1953 as a vision created by Col. Alvin E. Reilly to recognize the high caliber of entertainment available in the Air Force community. Over the span of 40 years, Tops In Blue has performed in films, produced albums and has been featured on national television with such legends as Ed Sullivan, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Barbara Mandrell and Alabama. In 1981, the cast performed the half-time show for the Garden State Bowl in New Jersey. With an estimated 110 million people watching worldwide, the cast presented the half-time entertainment show \"The World of Children's Dreams\" for Super Bowl XIX, Jan. 20, 1985.\n\r\nTops In Blue has contributed immeasurably to the ideals of America by representing the United States as both military and American ambassadors. In 1993, the unit traveled for the first time to Central and Eastern Europe bringing the music of America to 10 countries in the heart of the previous Soviet Bloc. Tops In Blue continues to bring a touch of home, a touch of America and above all, the pride of the Air Force to all their audiences."

    "description": "MissionThe U-2 provides high-altitude, all-weather surveillance and reconnaissance, day or night, in direct support of U.S. and allied forces. It delivers critical imagery and signals intelligence to decision makers throughout all phases of conflict, including peacetime indications and warnings, low-intensity conflict, and large-scale hostilities.FeaturesThe U-2S is a single-seat, single-engine, high-altitude/near space reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft providing signals, imagery, and electronic measurements and signature intelligence, or MASINT. Long and narrow wings give the U-2 glider-like characteristics and allow it to quickly lift heavy sensor payloads to unmatched altitudes, keeping them there for extended periods of time. The U-2 is capable of gathering a variety of imagery, including multi-spectral electro-optic, infrared, and synthetic aperture radar products which can be stored or sent to ground exploitation centers. In addition, it also supports high-resolution, broad-area synoptic coverage provided by the optical bar camera producing traditional film products which are developed and analyzed after landing.The U-2 also carries a signals intelligence payload. All intelligence products except for wet film can be transmitted in near real-time anywhere in the world via air-to-ground or air-to-satellite data links, rapidly providing critical information to combatant commanders. MASINT provides indications of recent activity in areas of interest and reveals efforts to conceal the placement or true nature of man-made objects.Routinely flown at altitudes over 70,000 feet, the U-2 pilot must wear a full pressure suit similar to those worn by astronauts. The low-altitude handling characteristics of the aircraft and bicycle-type landing gear require precise control inputs during landing; forward visibility is also limited due to the extended aircraft nose and \"taildragger\" configuration. A second U-2 pilot normally \"chases\" each landing in a high-performance vehicle, assisting the pilot by providing radio inputs for altitude and runway alignment. These characteristics combine to earn the U-2 a widely accepted title as the most difficult aircraft in the world to fly.The U-2 is powered by a lightweight , fuel efficient General Electric F118-101 engine, which negates the need for air refueling on long duration missions. The U-2S Block 10 electrical system upgrade replaced legacy wiring with advanced fiber-optic technology and lowered the overall electronic noise signature to provide a quieter platform for the newest generation of sensors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA U-2 Dragon Lady flies over the airfield at Beale Air Force Base, California, April 12, 2018.

Early flights over the Soviet Union in the late 1950s provided the president and other U.S. decision makers with key intelligence on Soviet military capability. In October 1962, the U-2 photographed the buildup of Soviet offensive nuclear missiles in Cuba, touching off the Cuban Missile Crisis. In more recent times, the U-2 has provided intelligence during operations in Korea, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. When requested, the U-2 also provides peacetime reconnaissance in support of disaster relief from floods, earthquakes, and forest fires as well as search and rescue operations.The U-2R, first flown in 1967, was 40 percent larger and more capable than the original aircraft. A tactical reconnaissance version, the TR-1A, first flew in August 1981 and was structurally identical to the U-2R. The last U-2 and TR-1 aircraft were delivered in October 1989; in 1992 all TR-1s and U-2s were designated as U-2Rs. Since 1994, $1.7 billion has been invested to modernize the U-2 airframe and sensors. These upgrades also included the transition to the GE F118-101 engine which resulted in the re-designation of all Air Force U-2 aircraft to the U-2S.U-2s are home based at the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, Beale Air Force Base, California, but are rotated to operational detachments worldwide.

    "title": "United States Air Force Academy",
    "description": "The United States Air Force Academy offers a four-year program of instruction and experience designed to provide cadets the knowledge and character essential for leadership, and the motivation to serve as Air Force career officers. Each cadet graduates with a bachelor of science degree and a commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Force.\n\nCourse of Study\r\nCadets are exposed to a balanced curriculum that provides a general and professional foundation essential to a career Air Force officer. Special needs of future Air Force officers are met by professionally oriented courses, including human physiology, computer science, economics, military history, astronautics, law and political science.\n\r\nThe core curriculum includes courses in basic\u00a0science, engineering, social sciences and humanities. Cadets take additional elective courses to complete requirements for one of 31 major areas of study. About 60 percent of the cadets complete majors in science and engineering; the other 40 percent graduate in the social sciences and humanities. Some of the most popular majors include management, biology,\u00a0behavioral science, civil engineering, aeronautical engineering, foreign area studies, and mechanical engineering.\n\nFaculty Composition\r\nThe majority of the academy's nearly\u00a0550 faculty members are Air Force officers. They are selected primarily from career-officer volunteers who have established outstanding records of performance and dedication. Each has at least a master's degree and more than\u00a040 percent have doctorates.\n\r\nIn addition to imparting knowledge, each faculty member must assist with the development of character and qualities of leadership essential to future Air Force career officers and the motivation of service to country. To provide greater contributions by a diverse faculty, the academy has several distinguished civilian professors and associate professors who serve one or more years. Officers from other services are members of the faculty as well, and a small number of officers from allied countries teach in the foreign language, history and political science departments. Distinguished civilian and military lecturers also share their expertise with the cadets during the academic year.\n\nAthletic Program\r\nThe academy's athletic program is designed to improve physical fitness, teach athletic skills and develop leadership qualities. To achieve its goals, the academy offers some of the most extensive physical education, intramural sports and intercollegiate athletic programs in the nation. Cadets take at least three different physical education courses each year.\n\nMilitary Education and Training\r\nAn aerospace-oriented military education, training and leadership program begins with basic cadet training and continues throughout the four years. Seniors are responsible for the leadership of the cadet wing, while juniors and sophomores perform lower-level leadership and instructional tasks. Cadets are projected into as many active leadership roles as possible to prepare them to be effective Air Force officers.\n\r\nFundamental concepts of military organization -- drill, ethics, honor, Air Force heritage and physical training -- are emphasized the first summer during basic cadet training. Freshmen then study the military role in U.S. society as well as the mission and organization of the Air Force. Sophomores receive instruction in communicative skills, and juniors study the combat and operational aspects of the Air Force. Military studies for the senior class focus on military thought.\n\r\nThe academy offers courses in flying, navigation, soaring and parachuting, building from basic skills to instructor duties. Cadets may fly light aircraft with the Cadet Flying Team. Those not qualified for flight training must enroll in a basic aviation course. Astronomy and advanced navigation courses also are available. Students bound for pilot training enroll in the flight screening program at the academy and fly the DA-20 Katana aircraft.\n\r\nSummer training for cadets is divided into three, three-week training periods. There are a variety of programs available, and each cadet is required to complete two training periods each summer with leave during the other period. All new cadets take six weeks of basic cadet training in their first summer.\n\r\nCombat survival training is a required three-week program during cadets' second summer. For other second-summer training periods, cadets have options such as working with young airmen in an operational unit at an Air Force installation, airborne parachute training, soaring or basic free-fall parachute training.\n\r\nDuring their last two summers, all cadets are offered leadership training as supervisors or instructors in summer programs, such as basic cadet training, survival training, freefall parachuting and soaring.\n\r\nExtracurricular activities also are an integral part of the education program. The cadet ski club, drum and bugle corps, cadet chorale and forensics are a few of the programs available.\n\nNominations\r\nNominations to the academy may be obtained through a congressional sponsor or by meeting eligibility criteria in other categories of competition established by law. For information on admission procedures, write to HQ USAFA/RRS; 2304 Cadet Drive, Suite 200; USAF Academy, CO 80840-5025.\n\nHistory\r\nIn 1948 a board of leading civilian and military educators was appointed to plan the curriculum for an academy that would meet the needs of the newly established Air Force. The board determined that Air Force requirements could not be met by expanding the other service academies and recommended an Air Force academy be established without delay.\n\r\nIn 1949, then Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington appointed a commission to assist in selecting a site and on April 1, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized creation of the United States Air Force Academy. After considering 580 sites in 45 states, the commission narrowed the choice to three locations. The summer of 1954, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Talbott selected a site near Colorado Springs, Colo. Colorado contributed $1 million toward purchase of the property.\n\r\nIn July 1955, the first academy class entered interim facilities at Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, while construction began. It was sufficiently completed for occupancy by the cadet wing in late August 1958. Initial construction cost was $142 million.\n\r\nWomen entered the academy on June 28, 1976, as members of the class of 1980."

It is the air component for two Department of Defense unified commands - U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM).\u00a0\n\nMission\u00a0\n\r\nAs the air component for both USEUCOM and USAFRICOM, USAFE-AFAFRICA executes the Air Force, USEUCOM and USAFRICOM missions with forward-based airpower and infrastructure to conduct and enable theater and global operations. USAFE-AFAFRICA directs air operations in a theater spanning three continents, covering more than 15 million square miles, containing 104 independent states, and possessing more than one-fifth of the world's population and more than a quarter of the world's gross domestic product.\u00a0\n\r\nDuring most of the Cold War, USAFE-AFAFRICA was a fight-in-place force postured for a large-scale conflict. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, it has transitioned to an Air Expeditionary Force with a mobile and deployable mix of people and resources that can simultaneously operate in multiple locations. Its role includes war-fighting as well as humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, and other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility.\u00a0\n\r\nIn peacetime, USAFE-AFAFRICA trains and equips Air Force units pledged to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to the peace and stability of African states. In fulfilling its NATO responsibilities, USAFE-AFAFRICA maintains combat-ready wings based from the United Kingdom to Turkey. USAFE-AFAFRICA plans, conducts, controls, coordinates and supports air and space operations in Europe and Africa to achieve U.S. national and NATO objectives based on taskings by the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM commanders.\n\r\nUSAFE-AFAFRICA assets stand ready to perform close air support, air interdiction, air defense, in-flight refueling, long-range transport and support of maritime operations. It maintains a formidable force despite a rapid drawdown that saw its main operating bases cut by 67 percent following the end of the Cold War. USAFE-AFAFRICA remains a highly responsive and capable combat force, as witnessed in the command's support of contingency and humanitarian operations throughout Europe and Africa.\n\nPersonnel and Resources\u00a0\n\r\nMore than 35,000 active-duty, Reserve, Air National Guard and civilian employees are assigned to USAFE-AFAFRICA. Equipment assets include about 217 fighter, attack, rotary wing, tanker, and transport aircraft, and a full complement of conventional weapons.\u00a0\n\nOrganization\u00a0\n\r\nUSAFE-AFAFRICA consists of one numbered air force, seven main operating bases and 114 geographically separated locations.\u00a0\r\nThird Air Force supports USEUCOM and USAFRICOM as the component numbered air force responsible for maintaining continuous theater-wide situational awareness and providing the commander of Air Force forces here the capability to command and control assigned and attached Airmen.\u00a0\n\r\nThe USAFE-AFAFRICA main operating bases are: RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom; Ramstein and Spangdahlem Air Bases in Germany; Aviano Air Base, Italy; Lajes Field in the Azores; and Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. These bases report to Third Air Force for day-to-day and contingency operations.\n\nHistory\u00a0\n\r\nUSAFE-AFAFRICA originated as the 8th Air Force in 1942 during its bombardment missions in World War II. The command was officially given the name \"U.S. Air Forces in Europe\" in August 1945.\u00a0\n\r\nDuring the Berlin Airlift from 1948-1949, USAFE was responsible for transporting more than 1.6 million tons of food, fuel and medical supplies to Berlin and continued to play a strategic role in deterring Soviet aggression until its break-up in 1991.\n\r\nSince the early 1990s, USAFE has played integral roles in multiple military combat operations, including operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Operation Allied Force, operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, and operation Odyssey Dawn.\u00a0\n\r\nIn addition to combat operations, USAFE has greatly contributed to several humanitarian operations, including Operations Provide Comfort and Northern Watch, and Operations Provide Promise and Joint Task Force Shining Hope. USAFE also provided humanitarian assistance to Georgia during its conflict with Russia in August 2008.\n\r\nUSAFE became USAFE-AFAFRICA on April 20, 2012, when 17th Air Force, which previously served as the air component for AFRICOM, officially stood down and transferred its mission responsibility to USAFE.\n\r\nWith the command now entering its eighth decade of active service, USAFE-AFAFRICA continues to provide combat ready forces, maintain vital access to three continents, and give support to friends and allies while building their operational capacity.\n\nPoint of Contact\u00a0\r\nU.

It was nicknamed \u201cIndependence\u201d after President Truman\u2019s hometown, Independence, Missouri. President Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled aboard a VC-121A and VC-121E, both nicknamed \"Columbine II\" and \"Columbine III\", from 1953 to 1961. These two aircraft were named after the official state flower of Colorado in honor of Mrs. Eisenhower\u2019s home state. While the call sign \"Air Force One\" was first used in the 50s, President Kennedy's VC-137 was the first aircraft to be popularly known as \"Air Force One.\"\u00a0\nIn 1962, a VC-137C specifically purchased for use as Air Force One, entered into service with the tail number 26000. It is perhaps the most widely known and most historically significant presidential aircraft. Tail number 26000 is the aircraft that carried President Kennedy to Dallas, Nov. 22, 1963, and returned the body to Washington, D.C., following his assassination. Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn into office as the 36th president on board the aircraft at Love Field in Dallas. In 1972 President Richard M. Nixon made historic visits aboard 26000 to the People's Republic of China and to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nTail number 27000 replaced 26000 and carved its own history when it was used to fly Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter to Cairo, Egypt, Oct. 19, 1981, to represent the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\nThe first VC-25A \u2014 tail number 28000 \u2014 flew as \"Air Force One\" on Sept. 6, 1990, when it transported President George Bush to Kansas, Florida and back to Washington, D.C. A second VC-25A, tail number 29000 transported Presidents Clinton, Carter and Bush to Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Tail number 29000 also carved its name in history on September 11, 2001, when President George W. Bush was interrupted as he attended an event at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, after the attack on the World Trade Center South Tower in New York City. The aircrew safely returned the President and staff members back to Washington, D.C. despite increased threats.\u00a0\n\r\nOn March 23, 2016, tail number 28000 had the honor of transporting President Barack Obama on a historic trip to Cuba. It was the first visit by a sitting U.S. president since President Calvin Coolidge in 1928. \u00a0\n\r\nToday, these aircraft are operated and maintained by the Presidential Airlift Group, and are assigned to Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing located at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. \u00a0The VC-25A continues the unique mission of presidential travel, upholding the proud tradition and distinction of being known as \"Air Force One.\"\nGeneral Characteristics\nPrimary Function: Presidential air transport\nContractor: Boeing Airplane Co.\nPower Plant: Four General Electric CF6-80C2B1 jet engines\nThrust: 56,700 pounds, each engine\nLength: 231 feet, 10 inches (70.7 meters)\nHeight: 63 feet, 5 inches (19.3 meters)\nWingspan: 195 feet, 8 inches (59.6 meters)\nSpeed: 630 miles per hour (Mach 0.92)\nCeiling: 45,100 feet (13,746 meters)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 833,000 pounds (374,850 kilograms)\nRange: 7,800 statute miles (6,800 nautical miles) (12,550 kilometers)\nCrew: 30\nPassengers: 71 \u00a0\nIntroduction Date: Dec. 8, 1990 (No. 28000); Dec. 23, 1990 (No. 29000)\nDate Deployed: Sept. 6, 1990 (No. 28000); Mar. 26, 1991 (No. 29000)\nInventory: Active force, 2; ANG, 0; Reserve, 0\n\r\n(Current as of February 2021)"

The WC-130J is the weather data collection platform for the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron located at Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.\n\nFeatures \r\nThe WC-130J is a C-130J transport configured with palletized weather instrumentation that collects weather data, and is capable of staying aloft almost 18 hours at an optimum cruise speed of more than 300 mph.\n\r\nThe WC-130 provides vital tropical cyclone forecasting information. It penetrates tropical cyclones and hurricanes at altitudes ranging from 500 to 10,000 feet (151.7 to 3,033.3 meters) above the ocean surface depending upon the intensity of the storm.\n\r\nAn average weather reconnaissance mission might last 11 hours and cover almost 3,500 miles while the crew collects and reports weather data. The WC-130J carries a minimal crew of five: pilot, co-pilot, navigator, aerial reconnaissance weather officer and weather reconnaissance loadmaster.\n\r\nThe aircraft is equipped with two external 1,400 gallon (5,320-liter) fuel tanks and an internal 1,800 gallon (6,480 liter) fuel tank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAircrew members from the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \u201cHurricane Hunters\u201d taxi a WC-130J Super Hercules aircraft to its parking spot on the runway at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, after a winter storm flight Jan. 12, 2018.

The weather officer also evaluates other meteorological conditions such as turbulence, icing, visibility, cloud types and amounts and ocean surface winds. The ARWO uses the equipment to determine the storm's center and analyze atmospheric conditions such as pressure, temperature, dew point and wind speed.\n\r\nA critical piece of weather equipment on board the WC-130J is the dropsonde system. The GPS Dropsonde Windfinding System is a cylindrically-shaped instrument about 16 inches long and 3.5 inches in diameter and weighs approximately 2.5 pounds. The dropsonde is equipped with a high frequency radio and other sensing devices and is released from the aircraft around every 400 miles over water. As the instrument descends to the sea surface, it measures and relays to the aircraft a vertical atmospheric profile of the temperature, humidity and barometric pressure and wind data. The dropsonde is slowed and stabilized by a small parachute. The dropsonde system operator receives, analyzes and encodes the data for transmission by satellite.\n\r\nIn May 2007, the WC-130J were equipped with the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer, which continuously measures the surface winds and rainfall rates below the aircraft.\n\nBackground\r\nThe WC-130 is flown exclusively from Keesler AFB by the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, an AFRC organization assigned to the 403rd Wing known as the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane reconnaissance area includes the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and eastern and central Pacific Ocean areas.\n\r\nThe WC-130J Hercules is a modified version of the C-130 transport configured with computerized weather instrumentation for penetration of severe storms.\n\r\nThe WC-130B became operational in 1959, the E model in 1962, followed by the H model in 1964. Only the J model is currently in operation and replaced the H model.\n\r\nThe aircraft's most important function is to collect high-density, high-accuracy weather data from within the storm's environment. This includes penetration of the vortex, or hurricane eye, of the storm. The aircraft normally flies a radius of about 100 miles from the vortex to collect detailed data about the structure of the tropical cyclone\n\r\nThe information collected makes possible advance warning of hurricanes and increases the accuracy of hurricane predictions and warnings by as much as 30 percent. Collected data are relayed directly to the National Hurricane Center, in Miami, a Department of Commerce weather agency that tracks hurricanes and provides warning service in the Atlantic area.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Weather reconnaissance\nContractor: Lockheed-Martin Corp.\nPower Plant: Four Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprops\nThrust: More than 4,700 horsepower each engine\nWingspan: 132 feet, 6 inches (39.7 meters)\nLength: 99 feet, 4 inches (30.10 meters)\nHeight: 38 feet, 6 inches (11.67 meters)\nMaximum Takeoff Weight: 155,000 pounds (69,750 kilograms)\nSpeed: 417 mph (Mach 0.59; 362 knots per hour) at 22,000 feet\nRange: 1,841 miles (1,600 nautical miles) with payload\nCeiling: 28,000 feet (8,615 meters)\nArmament: none\nCrew: Five (pilot, co-pilot, navigator, aerial reconnaissance weather officer and weather reconnaissance loadmaster/dropsonde system operator)\nDate Deployed: 1964\nUnit Cost: Approximately $13 million (1960 dollars)\nInventory: Active force; 0; ANG, 0; Reserve, 10\n\n(Current as of May 2014)"

    "description": "Mission\r\nThe experimental X-51A Waverider is an unmanned, autonomous supersonic combustion ramjet-powered hypersonic flight test demonstrator for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nFeatures\r\nThe X-51A is designed to be launched from an airborne B-52 Stratofortress bomber. The flight test vehicle stack is approximately 25 feet long and includes a modified solid rocket booster from an Army Tactical Missile, a connecting interstage, and the X-51A cruiser. The nearly wingless cruiser is designed to ride its own shockwave, thus the nickname, Waverider. The distinctive, shark-nosed cruiser has small controllable fins and houses the heart of the system, an SJY61 supersonic combustion ramjet or scramjet engine built by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne designed to burn JP-7 jet fuel. Boeing's Phantom Works performed overall air vehicle design, assembly and testing for the X-51's various component systems.\n\r\nThe X-51 was made primarily using standard aerospace materials such as aluminum, steel, inconel, and titanium. Some carbon/carbon composites of the leading edges of fins and cowls are used. For thermal protection, the vehicle utilizes a Boeing designed silica-based thermal protection system as well as Boeing Reusable Insulation tiles, similar to those on board the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiters.\n\r\nFour X-51As were built for the Air Force. The X-51A program is a technology demonstrator and was not designed to be a prototype for weapon system. It was designed to pave the way to future hypersonic weapons, hypersonic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance,\u00a0and future access to space. Since scramjets are able to burn atmospheric oxygen, they don't need to carry large fuel tanks containing oxidizer like conventional rockets, and are being explored as a way to more efficiently launch payloads into orbit.\n\r\nIn addition to scalable scramjet propulsion, other key technologies that will be demonstrated by the X-51A include thermal protection systems materials, airframe and engine integration, and high-speed stability and control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X-51A Waverider is set to demonstrate hypersonic flight.

For example, hypersonic speeds on the order of flying 600 nautical miles in 10 minutes may provide the ability to accurately engage a long-distance target very rapidly.\n\r\nThe X-51A program is a collaborative effort of the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, with industry partners The Boeing Company and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. Program management is accomplished by the Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.\n\r\nHypersonic flight, normally defined as beginning at Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, presents unique technical challenges with heat and pressure, which make conventional turbine engines impractical. Program officials said producing thrust with a scramjet has been compared to lighting a match in a hurricane and keeping it burning.\n\r\nThe Air Force currently plans to fly each X-51A on identical flight profiles. Like the X-15, the X-51A is designed to be carried aloft by a B-52 mother ship launched from the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. It is released at approximately 50,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center Sea Range. The solid rocket booster accelerates the X-51A for 30 seconds to approximately Mach 4.5, before being jettisoned. Then the cruiser's scramjet engine, remarkable because it has virtually no moving parts, ignites. The ignition sequence begins burning ethylene, transitioning over approximately 10 seconds to the same JP-7 jet fuel once used by the SR-71 Blackbird.\n\r\nPowered by its scramjet engine, the X-51A will accelerate to approximately Mach 6 as it climbs to nearly 70,000 feet. Hypersonic combustion generates intense heat so routing of the engine's own JP-7 fuel will serve to both cool the engine and heat the fuel to optimum operating temperature for combustion. The fuel load and flight profile provides for a 240-second engine burn, transmitting vast amounts of telemetry data on its systems to orbiting aircraft and ground stations, before the vehicle exhausts its fuel supply, splashes down into the Pacific and is destroyed, as planned. Flight test vehicles are not recovered.\n\r\nThe X-51A development team elected from the outset not to build recovery systems in the flight test vehicles, in an effort to control costs and focus funding on the vehicle's fuel-cooled scramjet engine. A U.S. Navy P-3 Orion aids in transmitting telemetry data to engineers at both Naval Air Station Point Mugu and Vandenberg AFB, Calif., before it arrives at its final destination, the Ridley Mission Control Center at Edwards AFB.\n\r\nConceived in 2004, the X-51A made its first \"captive carry\" flight Dec. 9, 2009. The flight test verified the B-52's high-altitude performance and handling qualities with the X-51 attached and tested communications and telemetry systems, but the vehicle remained attached to the B-52s wing.\n\r\nThe X-51A made history during its first supersonic combustion ramjet-powered hypersonic flight May 26, 2010, off the southern California Pacific coast. Officials said the flight test vehicle flew as anticipated for nearly 200 seconds, with the scramjet accelerating the vehicle to approximately Mach 5, nearly 3,400 miles per hour. The fuel-cooled scramjet performed as planned transmitting normal telemetry for more than 140 seconds, then observing a decrease in thrust and acceleration for another 30 seconds. An anomaly then resulted in a loss of telemetry, and the test was terminated and vehicle was destroyed by flight controllers on command.\n\r\nDespite the anomaly, the May 26 flight is considered the first use of a practical hydrocarbon fueled scramjet in flight. The longest previous hypersonic scramjet flight test performed by a NASA X-43 in 2004 was faster, but lasted only about 12 seconds and used less logistically supportable hydrogen fuel.\n\r\nFollowing an extensive analysis of flight data from the X-51A's first hypersonic flight test, slight modifications are planned to strengthen the rear seal area near the engine exhaust nozzles for the three remaining X-51As.\n\r\nThe next two X-51A flights ended prematurely. The second vehicle was boosted by the rocket to just over Mach 5, separated and lit the scramjet on ethylene. When the vehicle attempted to transition to JP7 fuel operation, it experienced an inlet un-start. The hypersonic vehicle attempted to restart and oriented itself to optimize engine start conditions, but was unsuccessful. The vehicle continued in a controlled flight orientation until it flew into the ocean within the test range.\n\r\nThe third X-51A safely separated from the B-52, however after 16 seconds under the rocket booster, a fault was identified with one of the cruiser control fins. Once the X-51 separated from the rocket booster, approximately 15 seconds later, the cruiser was not able to maintain control due to the faulty control fin and was lost.\n\r\nThe final flight of the X-51A occurred May 1, 2013 and was the most successful in terms of meeting all the experiment objectives. The cruiser traveled more than 230 nautical miles in just over six minutes reaching a peak speed of Mach 5.1.\n\r\nOverall the more than 9 minutes of data collected from the X-51A program was an unprecedented achievement proving the viability of air-breathing, high-speed scramjet propulsion using hydrocarbon fuel.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\r\nPrimary Function: Hypersonic scramjet-powered flight test demonstrator\nContractors: Boeing, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne\nPower Plant: JP-7 fueled/cooled SJY61 supersonic combustion ramjet\nThrust: 500 - 1,000 pound class\nLength: Full stack 25 feet; Cruiser 14 feet; Interstage 5 feet; Solid rocket booster 6 feet\nWeight: Approx. 4,000 pounds\nFuel Capacity: Approx. 270 pounds JP-7\nSpeed: 3,600+ miles per hour (at Mach 6)\nRange: 400+ nautical miles\nCeiling: 70,000 + feet\nCrew:\u00a0 ground station monitored\nUnit Cost: Unavailable\nInitial Flight Test: May 26, 2010\nInventory: Four purpose-built for flight test, not designed for recovery (one vehicle expended as of Feb. 1, 2011)"
